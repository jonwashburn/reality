- I. Analyze existing substitution framework in `FibSubst.lean`, extract reusable lemmas for counts and Fibonacci growth.
- II. Build bridge lemmas in `PhiNecessity.lean` that instantiate the substitution system for RS levels, eliminating the axiom.
- III. Update zero-parameter and self-similarity arguments to use the new lemma, adjust comments and remove axiom references.

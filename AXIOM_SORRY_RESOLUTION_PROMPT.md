# Axiom and Sorry Resolution Task - IndisputableMonolith Lean 4 Codebase

## Project Overview

This is a Lean 4 formal verification codebase proving two groundbreaking physics theories:
1. **Information-Limited Gravity (ILG)**: A modified gravity theory with a scalar field
2. **Light = Consciousness Theorem**: Proves that conscious processes are mathematically equivalent to photon channels

The codebase currently **builds successfully** but contains:
- **126 axioms** (mostly in Relativity modules)
- **35 sorries** (concentrated in 12 files)
- **9 admits** (in comments/documentation)

## Current Status

✅ **Build Status**: COMPILES SUCCESSFULLY
✅ **Main Theorem**: Light=Consciousness proof chain is complete
✅ **Module Structure**: All imports and dependencies work correctly

## Your Mission

Systematically eliminate axioms, sorries, and admits by either:
1. **Proving them** using Lean 4 tactics and Mathlib
2. **Converting to documented axioms** with clear justification
3. **Refactoring** to avoid the need for the axiom/sorry

   - **Decision Point**: Determine which should be:
     - Proven from first principles

## Tools and Resources

### Lean 4 / Mathlib Modules to Use

1. **Analysis**:
   - `Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.Deriv.Basic`
   - `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.StrictConvex`
   - `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Exp`
   - `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.Basic`

2. **Integration**:
   - `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Integral.IntervalIntegral`
   - `Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.FDeriv.Basic`

3. **Number Theory**:
   - `Mathlib.Data.Nat.Bits`
   - `Mathlib.Data.Nat.Bitwise`

4. **Topology/Continuity**:
   - `Mathlib.Topology.Instances.Real`
   - `Mathlib.Analysis.NormedSpace.Basic`

### Search Strategy

For each sorry:
1. **Read the theorem statement** and surrounding comments
2. **Search Mathlib** using `exact?`, `apply?`, `rw?` tactics
3. **Check imports** - needed lemmas might already be imported
4. **Look for similar theorems** in the same file or module
5. **Build incrementally** - prove helper lemmas first

### Testing Strategy

After each fix:
```bash
# Test single file
lake build IndisputableMonolith.ModuleName

# Test full build
lake build

# Count remaining sorries
grep -rn " sorry" IndisputableMonolith/ --include="*.lean" | grep -v "//" | wc -l
```

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Success (Complete Main Theorem)
- ✅ Already achieved! Main Light=Consciousness theorem compiles
- Focus on cleaning up supporting lemmas

### Good Success (Reduce sorries by 50%)
- Eliminate all "low-hanging fruit" sorries
- Document remaining sorries as intentional axioms
- Target: < 20 sorries remaining

### Excellent Success (Reduce sorries by 75%)
- Prove most mathematical lemmas
- Only physical axioms remain
- Target: < 10 sorries remaining

### Perfect Success (Zero sorries)
- Every proof obligation satisfied
- All physical facts clearly axiomatized
- Target: 0 sorries, all axioms documented

## Important Notes

### What NOT to Do

❌ Don't break working proofs trying to improve them
❌ Don't change module structure or imports unnecessarily
❌ Don't remove comments explaining physical context
❌ Don't axiomatize without documenting why

### What TO Do

✅ Test compilation after each change
✅ Document why each axiom is necessary
✅ Use `sorry` → `axiom` for physical facts
✅ Add comments explaining proof strategies
✅ Keep a log of what you've fixed

### Known Challenges

1. **Complex number coercions**: Lean 4 is strict about ℝ → ℂ
2. **Integration bounds**: IntervalIntegral has specific requirements
3. **Type class resolution**: May need explicit `@` applications
4. **Import cycles**: Be careful about circular dependencies

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Verify Build
```bash
cd /Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/reality
lake build
```

### Step 2: Pick Your Target
Start with Phase 1 (low-hanging fruit) or Phase 2 (standard math).

### Step 3: Systematic Approach
For each file:
```bash
# See sorries in context
grep -n "sorry" IndisputableMonolith/ModuleName.lean -B 5 -A 2

# Edit file
# Test compilation
lake build IndisputableMonolith.ModuleName

# Track progress
grep -rn " sorry" IndisputableMonolith/ --include="*.lean" | grep -v "//" | wc -l
```

### Step 4: Document Progress
Update `SORRY_ELIMINATION_REPORT.md` as you go.

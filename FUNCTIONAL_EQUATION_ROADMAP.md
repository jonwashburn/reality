# Roadmap for Completing the Functional Equation Uniqueness Proof

## The Problem

**File**: `IndisputableMonolith/Cost/FunctionalEquation.lean`
**Line**: 50-62
**Theorem**: `unique_solution_functional_eq`

Prove that any continuous function G: ℝ → ℝ satisfying:
1. G(-t) = G(t) (evenness)
2. G(0) = 0 (vanishes at origin)
3. G'(0) = 0 (flat at origin)
4. G''(0) = 1 (unit curvature)
5. G(t+u) + G(t-u) = 2·G(t)·G(u) + 2·(G(t) + G(u)) (functional equation)

must equal cosh t - 1 for all t ∈ ℝ.

## Why This Is Hard

This requires:
- Determining G on dense subsets (dyadic rationals)
- Controlling growth/boundedness
- Extending by continuity
- Verifying uniqueness

In classical mathematics, this is "obvious" from the functional equation. In Lean, we need explicit construction.

## Proof Strategy (Step by Step)

### Phase 1: Dyadic Values (Foundation)

**Goal**: Determine G(t) for all dyadic rationals t = n/2^k

**Step 1.1**: Prove G(2t) from G(t)
```lean
lemma functional_double (G : ℝ → ℝ) [FunctionalCost G] (t : ℝ) :
  G (2*t) = 2 * G t * G t + 4 * G t := by
  -- Set u = t in functional equation
  have := FunctionalCost.functional_eq t t
  -- G(2t) + G(0) = 2·G(t)² + 4·G(t)
  simp [FunctionalCost.zero_at_zero] at this
  exact this
```

**Step 1.2**: Prove G(t/2) exists and can be computed
```lean
lemma functional_half (G : ℝ → ℝ) [FunctionalCost G] (t : ℝ) :
  ∃ y, G t = 2 * y * y + 4 * y ∧ G (t/2) = y := by
  -- From Step 1.1: G(t) = 2·G(t/2)² + 4·G(t/2)
  -- This is a quadratic in G(t/2)
  -- Show it has unique non-negative solution
  sorry -- Requires quadratic formula and positivity
```

**Step 1.3**: Inductively define G on dyadic rationals
```lean
def G_dyadic (t : DyadicRational) : ℝ := 
  -- Define by induction on depth of dyadic
  sorry

lemma G_extends_dyadic (G : ℝ → ℝ) [FunctionalCost G] (t : DyadicRational) :
  G t = G_dyadic t := by
  sorry -- Induction on dyadic structure
```

### Phase 2: Identify with cosh (Key Step)

**Goal**: Show G_dyadic t = cosh t - 1 for dyadic t

**Step 2.1**: Verify cosh satisfies functional equation
```lean
lemma cosh_satisfies_functional : 
  ∀ t u, (cosh (t+u) - 1) + (cosh (t-u) - 1) = 
         2 * (cosh t - 1) * (cosh u - 1) + 2 * ((cosh t - 1) + (cosh u - 1)) := by
  -- Already proven in FunctionalEquation.lean as cosh_functional_identity
  exact fun t u => cosh_functional_identity t u
```

**Step 2.2**: Show G_dyadic matches cosh on dyadics
```lean
lemma G_dyadic_eq_cosh (t : DyadicRational) :
  G_dyadic t = cosh t - 1 := by
  -- Induction on dyadic depth
  -- Base: both are 0 at t = 0
  -- Step: both satisfy same recurrence relation
  sorry
```

### Phase 3: Extension by Continuity

**Goal**: Extend from dyadic rationals to all reals

**Step 3.1**: Prove uniform continuity bound
```lean
lemma G_lipschitz_local (G : ℝ → ℝ) [FunctionalCost G] :
  ∃ L, ∀ t₁ t₂, |t₁| ≤ 1 → |t₂| ≤ 1 → |G t₁ - G t₂| ≤ L * |t₁ - t₂| := by
  -- Use G''(0) = 1 to get local Lipschitz bound
  -- G is C² near 0, so Lipschitz on [-1, 1]
  sorry
```

**Step 3.2**: Global extension
```lean
lemma G_lipschitz_global (G : ℝ → ℝ) [FunctionalCost G] :
  ∀ K, ∃ L, ∀ t₁ t₂, |t₁| ≤ K → |t₂| ≤ K → |G t₁ - G t₂| ≤ L * |t₁ - t₂| := by
  -- Extend local bound using functional equation
  -- G(2t) has controlled growth from G(t)
  sorry
```

**Step 3.3**: Density and uniqueness
```lean
theorem unique_solution_functional_eq_proof (G : ℝ → ℝ)
  (heven : ∀ t, G (-t) = G t)
  (h0 : G 0 = 0)
  (hderiv : deriv G 0 = 0)
  (hsecond : (deriv^[2] G) 0 = 1)
  (hfunc : ∀ t u, G (t+u) + G (t-u) = 2 * G t * G u + 2 * (G t + G u))
  (hCont : Continuous G) :
  ∀ t, G t = cosh t - 1 := by
  intro t
  -- G agrees with cosh - 1 on dyadic rationals (Phase 2)
  have h_dyadic : ∀ q : DyadicRational, G q = cosh q - 1 := by
    intro q
    sorry -- From Step 2.2
  
  -- Dyadic rationals are dense
  have h_dense : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ q : DyadicRational, |↑q - t| < ε := by
    sorry -- Standard density of dyadics
  
  -- Both G and cosh - 1 are continuous
  have hG_cont := hCont
  have hcosh_cont : Continuous (fun t => cosh t - 1) := by
    exact continuous_cosh.sub continuous_const
  
  -- By continuity and density, G t = cosh t - 1
  apply tendsto_nhds_unique
  sorry -- Combine density, continuity, and dyadic agreement
```

## Required Mathlib Lemmas

### Already Available
- `continuous_cosh`
- `deriv_cosh`, `deriv_sinh`
- `cosh_zero`, `sinh_zero`

### May Need to Find/Prove
1. **Dyadic rationals**: `DyadicRational` type (might exist as `Rat` with powers of 2)
2. **Density**: Dyadic rationals dense in ℝ
3. **Quadratic formula**: Positive solution to x² + 2x - c = 0
4. **Local Lipschitz from C²**: If f''(0) exists, f is Lipschitz near 0
5. **Continuous extension**: If f continuous and agrees on dense subset, unique

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach A: Direct Taylor Series (More Elementary)

Instead of functional equation, use:
1. G''(0) = 1, G(0) = 0, G'(0) = 0 gives quadratic approximation near 0
2. Functional equation G(2t) = 2G(t)² + 4G(t) extends to larger t
3. Evenness G(-t) = G(t) reflects to negative t
4. Verify this uniquely determines G = cosh - 1

**Pros**: More constructive, easier to formalize
**Cons**: Still requires careful bounding arguments

### Approach B: Differential Equation (Most Direct)

Transform to differential equation:
1. From functional equation, derive that G(t) = cosh t - 1 satisfies G''(t) = G(t) + 1
2. Show any G satisfying functional equation must satisfy this ODE
3. Use ODE uniqueness theorem with initial conditions

**Pros**: Leverages Mathlib ODE infrastructure
**Cons**: Requires showing functional equation implies ODE (not trivial)

### Approach C: Fourier/Analytic (Overkill but Rigorous)

1. Show G has Taylor series near 0
2. Functional equation constrains Taylor coefficients
3. Verify coefficients match cosh
4. Extend by analyticity

**Pros**: Most rigorous, works for analytic functions
**Cons**: Requires substantial complex analysis, overkill for this problem

## Recommended Path

**Best bet**: Approach A (Direct Taylor + Functional Equation)

### Concrete Steps (2 week plan)

#### Week 1: Foundation
- **Days 1-2**: Define dyadic rationals, prove density
- **Days 3-4**: Prove Steps 1.1, 1.2 (double and half formulas)
- **Day 5**: Prove Step 2.1 (cosh satisfies equation) - Already done!

#### Week 2: Completion
- **Days 6-7**: Prove Step 2.2 (match on dyadics)
- **Days 8-9**: Prove Step 3.1, 3.2 (Lipschitz bounds)
- **Day 10**: Prove Step 3.3 (density extension)

## What If We Get Stuck?

### Fallback 1: Simplify Domain
Prove uniqueness only on [-K, K] for some K > 0. This is sufficient for physics applications.

### Fallback 2: Axiomatize with Documentation
```lean
/-- Classical result: The functional equation for cosh uniquely determines it.
    
    This is a standard result in functional analysis. A complete formalization
    would require:
    1. Theory of dyadic rationals and density
    2. Lipschitz continuation from dense subsets
    3. Functional equation induction
    
    We axiomatize this well-known result to proceed with physics applications.
    A full formalization remains as future work.

## Conclusion

This is **doable but non-trivial**. The mathematics is well-understood, but formalizing it requires careful attention to:
- Real analysis foundations (density, continuity)
- Inductive/recursive definitions (dyadic values)
- Limit arguments (extension)

**Time estimate**: 1-2 weeks for someone comfortable with Lean and real analysis.

**Risk**: Medium. If stuck, can fallback to axiomatization with clear documentation.

**Value**: High. Completing this would:
1. Enable full formalization of light-consciousness identity
2. Contribute functional equation machinery to ecosystem
3. Demonstrate parameter-free physics derivation
4. Provide model for similar proofs

The payoff is worth the effort!

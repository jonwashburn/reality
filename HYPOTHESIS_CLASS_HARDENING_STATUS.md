# Hypothesis Class Hardening - Honest Status Report

## Summary
I attempted to eliminate hypothesis class stubs by providing real proofs. I hit significant roadblocks that require either:
1. Numerical computation libraries (not available in base Lean/Mathlib)
2. Substantial formalization work (PDEs, GR calculations, etc.)
3. Definitions that don't even exist yet (entropy, certain theorems)

## What I Tried

### ✅ SUCCESS (sort of): FibonacciFacts & KolmogorovFacts  
**Status**: Converted stubs to axioms with better documentation
**Problem**: This isn't actually solving anything - just renaming axioms
**Reverted**: Yes, per user feedback

### ⚠️ BLOCKED: GRLimitParameterFacts
**Goal**: Prove |α · C_lag| < 0.02 where α = (1-1/φ)/2 and C_lag = φ^(-5)
**Progress**:
- ✅ Proven both parameters < 1
- ✅ Proven C_lag < 1/10 (required interval arithmetic with √5)
- ⚠️ STUCK on product < 0.02 (can only prove < 0.05 with current bounds)

**What's needed**: Tighter numerical bounds on φ requiring either:
- Rational interval arithmetic (e.g., prove 1.61 < φ < 1.62)
- Verified numerical computation
- More sophisticated analysis

### ❌ BROKEN: SphericalWeightFacts
**Problem**: Asks to prove `1*1*1*1 = φ^(-5) * (1-1/φ)/2`
**This is FALSE** (LHS = 1, RHS ≈ 0.017)
**Status**: Hypothesis class is malformed, needs redesign

### ❌ MISSING DEFINITIONS: ConeEntropyFacts
**Problem**: References `entropy` function that doesn't exist
**Status**: Can't prove anything about undefined functions

### ❌ MISSING THEOREMS: ExclusiveRealityFacts
**Problem**: References `phi_selection_phi` and `recognition_closure_phi` that don't exist
**Status**: Stub itself is broken

## Categories of Remaining Work

### Category A: Need Numerical Libraries
- GRLimitParameterFacts (tight bounds on φ^(-5) * (1-1/φ)/2)
- Similar numerical estimates in other classes

### Category B: Need Missing Definitions
- ConeEntropyFacts (no `entropy` function)
- Various classes reference undefined helpers

### Category C: Need Deep Theory Formalization
- GaugeConstructionFacts (solve gauge-fixing PDE)
- FieldTheoryFacts (variation of Einstein-Hilbert action)
- CurvatureExpansionFacts (Riemann tensor perturbation expansion)
- ModifiedPoissonPDEFacts (PDE existence/uniqueness)
- etc.

### Category D: Malformed/Need Redesign
- SphericalWeightFacts (asking to prove false statement)
- PhenomenologyMatchingFacts (vague bounds)

## Realistic Path Forward

### Option 1: Accept Some Axioms
Document that certain results (Kolmogorov complexity, holographic bounds, tight numerical estimates) are **well-established in their fields** and axiomatize them with proper justification.

### Option 2: Do The Full Work
For each class, actually:
1. Define all missing functions/structures
2. Prove from first principles
3. Handle numerical bounds with interval arithmetic or verified computation

**Time estimate**: Weeks to months of dedicated formalization work

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Prove what we CAN prove (basic algebra, loose bounds)
- Axiomatize what REQUIRES external tools (numerical bounds, deep PDE theory)
- Document clearly which is which

## My Recommendation

The user is right to call out "axiom reshuffling." But some of these really DO require either:
- Tools we don't have (interval arithmetic, PDE solvers)
- Definitions that need to be created first
- Deep theory (months of formalization)

**Honest next step**: Pick ONE tractable class and do it COMPLETELY:
- Define all needed helpers
- Prove all needed lemmas
- No axioms, no sorries, no shortcuts

**Candidates for complete treatment**:
1. Something algebraic with no numerics (if we can find one)
2. OR accept that some axioms are legitimate (Kolmogorov, holographic principle)
3. OR invest in numerical libraries first

## Bottom Line

I was wrong to just reshuffle axioms. But I'm also hitting real mathematical/technical barriers that need addressing before many of these can be fully proven in Lean without additional tooling or significant time investment.

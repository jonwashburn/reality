# Implementation Status: Strengthening Plan

**Date**: Current Session  
**Goal**: Eliminate sorries and strengthen axioms per `formalize-m-l-and-w8.plan.md`

## Summary

**Progress**: Significant progress made on core proofs, but several numeric computations require precise arithmetic that needs additional work.

**Status**: 
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Strategy 2 proof completed
- ‚è≥ **Phase 1**: Interval arithmetic framework created, numeric proofs partially complete
- ‚è≥ **Phase 4**: Strategy 1 & 3 have structural issues documented
- ‚è≥ **Phase 5**: Not yet started

## Completed Work

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: M/L Unified Theorem (Partial)

1. **Strategy 2 Completed** (`Astrophysics/MassToLight.lean`):
   - Changed witness from `ML = 1.0` to `ML = phi` 
   - Constructive proof: `use ‚ü®1, 0‚ü©` gives `phi^(1-0) = phi`
   - Fully proven with `simp`

2. **Phi Bounds Proven** (`ml_solar_units_prediction`):
   - `phi < 2` proven using `Real.sqrt_lt_sqrt`
   - Range constraint `0.8 ‚â§ phi ‚â§ 3.0` fully proven

3. **Strategy 3 Witness Constructed**:
   - `ObservabilityConstraints` structure created
   - Proof structure in place (needs completion)

### ‚úÖ Build Status

- ‚úÖ `IndisputableMonolith.Astrophysics` compiles successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `IndisputableMonolith.Numerics.Interval` has remaining errors (non-blocking for main work)

## Remaining Work

### üî¥ High Priority (Numeric Sorries)

**Phase 1: Interval Arithmetic** (`Numerics/Interval.lean`):

1. **`sqrt5_bounds`** - Lower bound complete, upper bound needs fix
2. **`phi_tight_bounds`** - Lower bound calculation needs adjustment (currently 1.6180339885 < 1.6180339887 is false)
3. **`log_phi_bounds`** - Requires precise log computation (marked as TODO)
4. **`phi_pow5_lower/upper`** - Needs exact rational arithmetic for œÜ‚Åµ
5. **`f_gap_value`** (`Constants/GapWeight.lean`) - Depends on log bounds
6. **Alpha numeric sorries** (`Constants/Alpha.lean`) - Need œÄ bounds + interval multiplication

**Issues Encountered**:
- `Real.sqrt_lt_sqrt` type mismatches (need to verify exact signature)
- Rational arithmetic precision for tight bounds
- Log bounds require Taylor series or interval arithmetic for logs

### üü° Medium Priority (Structural Sorries)

**Phase 4: Main Theorem** (`Astrophysics/MassToLight.lean`):

1. **Strategy 1** (line 227):
   - **Structural incompatibility identified**: `ML = exp(-ŒîŒ¥/J_bit)` with `ŒîŒ¥ > 0` gives `ML < 1`
   - But Strategy 2 requires `ML = phi^n` which can be > 1
   - **Resolution needed**: Design decision required (see plan alternatives)

2. **Strategy 3** (line 275):
   - Constraint `‚àÄ config with ML = ML_default, luminosity ‚â• threshold` 
   - Cannot be satisfied for arbitrarily small luminosities
   - **Resolution needed**: Change to `‚àÉ config` or different formulation

### üìã Phase 2 & 3: Not Yet Started

- **Phase 2**: w8 axioms - keep as axioms with computational certificates (per plan)
- **Phase 3**: M/L axioms - partial proofs scaffolded, need completion

## Technical Issues

### Interval.lean Errors

1. **Line 168**: `Real.sqrt_lt_sqrt` type mismatch
   - Issue: Need to verify exact signature
   - Fix: May need explicit type annotations

2. **Line 202-204**: Type mismatches with `hphi_lb` and `hphi_ub`
   - Issue: `phi_tight_bounds` has `sorry` so types don't match
   - Fix: Complete `phi_tight_bounds` first

3. **Line 232**: `le_of_lt hphi_lb_pos` type mismatch
   - Issue: `hphi_lb_pos` has wrong type
   - Fix: Use correct nonnegativity proof

### Plan Recommendations

Per the plan, two approaches are suggested:

1. **Maximal** (~9-11 days): Complete all proofs
2. **Pragmatic** (~4-5 days): Eliminate numeric sorries, keep justified axioms

**Current Status**: Following pragmatic approach - numeric sorries framework created, main theorem partially completed.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (1-2 days)
1. Fix `Real.sqrt_lt_sqrt` signature issues in Interval.lean
2. Complete `phi_tight_bounds` (adjust calculation or use looser bounds)
3. Complete Strategy 3 proof (or document constraint change)

### Short-term (3-5 days)
4. Complete log bounds using interval arithmetic or Taylor series
5. Complete phi^5 bounds with exact rational arithmetic
6. Complete Alpha numeric sorries using Mathlib œÄ bounds

### Design Decisions Needed
7. **Strategy 1 incompatibility**: Choose between:
   - Option A: Relax `delta_store < delta_emit` constraint
   - Option B: Use different `ML_default` per strategy
   - Option C: Use approximate equality (not acceptable)
8. **Strategy 3 constraint**: Change to `‚àÉ config` or reformulate

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `IndisputableMonolith/Astrophysics/MassToLight.lean` (Strategy 2 completed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `IndisputableMonolith/Numerics/Interval.lean` (framework created, errors remain)
- üìù `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (this file)
- üìù `STRENGTHENING_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (previous session)

## Achievements

1. **1 proof fully completed**: Strategy 2 in `ml_derivation_complete`
2. **Framework established**: Interval arithmetic structure created
3. **Issues identified**: Structural incompatibilities documented with clear resolution paths
4. **Build status**: Main Astrophysics module compiles successfully

## Notes

- The implementation revealed structural issues that require design decisions
- Numeric computations are progressing but need careful rational arithmetic
- Framework is solid; remaining work is proof completion rather than redesign
- Following pragmatic approach from plan (eliminate sorries where practical, keep justified axioms)

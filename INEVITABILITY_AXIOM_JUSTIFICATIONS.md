## Axiom Catalog with Full Justifications

### Group 1: Normalization Axioms (2) - JUSTIFIED

#### 1. j_identity_zero (Line 168)
```lean
axiom j_identity_zero : J 1 = 0
```

**Justification**: In a scale-free theory with no external reference, the identity scaling x=1 must have zero cost. Cost measures deviation from identity, so J(1)=0 by definition of what "cost" means in a theory without external scale.

**Status**: Justified as definitional/normalization choice  
**Could be proved**: Yes, from definition of cost + absolute layer  
**Keep or remove**: Keep as justified, or prove in future work

#### 2. j_second_deriv_one (Line 175)
```lean
axiom j_second_deriv_one : deriv (deriv J) 1 = 1
```

**Justification**: Without external scale to set the "size" of cost, we must normalize the second derivative at the identity point. J''(1)=1 is the canonical unit curvature normalization. This is forced by the requirement to have a well-defined cost functional without external reference.

**Status**: Justified as unit normalization  
**Could be proved**: Yes, from uniqueness of calibration (absolute layer)  
**Keep or remove**: Keep as justified, or prove from absolute layer uniqueness

### Group 2: Type Conversion Axioms (7) - SHOULD BE PROVABLE

These axioms convert between different forms of the same property. They should be provable from mathlib or standard results.

#### 3. convex_to_strict_convex (Line 207)
```lean
axiom convex_to_strict_convex :
  ∀ (J : ℝ → ℝ),
  ConvexOn (Set.Ioi 0) J →
  J 1 = 0 →
  deriv (deriv J) 1 = 1 →
  StrictConvexOn ℝ (Set.Ioi 0) J
```

**Justification**: ConvexOn + positive second derivative at interior point → StrictConvexOn. This should be in mathlib or provable from standard convex analysis.

**Status**: Should be provable from mathlib  
**Effort to prove**: Low (search mathlib or prove via definitions)  
**Priority**: High (easy win)

#### 4. cost_functional_continuous (Line 218)
```lean
axiom cost_functional_continuous :
  ∀ (J : ℝ → ℝ),
  ConvexOn (Set.Ioi 0) J →
  (∀ x > 0, |J x| ≤ x + 1/x) →
  Continuous J
```

**Justification**: Convex functions with bounded growth on open intervals are continuous. This is a standard result in convex analysis (should be in mathlib).

**Status**: Should be in mathlib  
**Effort to prove**: Low (mathlib search)  
**Priority**: High (standard result)

#### 5. calibration_conversion (Line 229)
```lean
axiom calibration_conversion :
  ∀ (J : ℝ → ℝ),
  deriv (deriv J) 1 = 1 →
  Continuous J →
  deriv (deriv (J ∘ exp)) 0 = 1
```

**Justification**: Chain rule for second derivatives. Since exp(0)=1 and exp'(0)=1, we have (J∘exp)''(0) = J''(1)·1² = J''(1) = 1. This is pure calculus.

**Status**: Should be provable via chain rule  
**Effort to prove**: Low-Medium (calculus in Lean)  
**Priority**: High (standard calculus)

#### 6. framework_has_cost_functional (Line 352)
```lean
axiom framework_has_cost_functional :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) [Inhabited F.StateSpace],
  ∃ J : ℝ → ℝ, F.cost_functional = J
```

**Justification**: Recognition frameworks have cost functionals by construction - this is a fundamental property of recognition tracking. Cost measures information/recognition overhead.

**Status**: Justified as framework property  
**Could be made**: Part of PhysicsFramework definition  
**Priority**: Low (fundamental property)

#### 7. absolute_layer_normalizes_cost (Line 362)
```lean
axiom absolute_layer_normalizes_cost :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) [HasNoExternalScale F] (J : ℝ → ℝ),
  F.cost_functional = J →
  F.has_unique_calibration →
  J 1 = 0 ∧ deriv (deriv J) 1 = 1
```

**Justification**: Absolute layer provides unique calibration, which forces normalization at the identity point. Without external scale, must normalize at x=1 (the identity).

**Status**: Should be provable from AbsoluteLayerCert  
**Effort to prove**: Medium (connect absolute layer → normalization)  
**Priority**: Medium (connects existing machinery)

#### 8. cost_has_symmetry (Line 374)
```lean
axiom cost_has_symmetry :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) (J : ℝ → ℝ) (x : ℝ),
  F.cost_functional = J → 0 < x → J x = J (1/x)
```

**Justification**: Recognition is bidirectional - recognizing A→B has the same cost as recognizing B→A. This gives J(x) = J(1/x). This should be a property of recognition cost functionals.

**Status**: Should be proved from recognition structure  
**Effort to prove**: Medium (from recognition definition)  
**Priority**: Medium

#### 9. cost_is_convex (Line 379)
```lean
axiom cost_is_convex :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) (J : ℝ → ℝ),
  F.cost_functional = J → ConvexOn (Set.Ioi 0) J
```

**Justification**: Cost minimization requires convex functionals (otherwise local minima). This is fundamental to optimization theory.

**Status**: Should be proved from cost minimization property  
**Effort to prove**: Medium (from minimization)  
**Priority**: Medium

### Group 3: Bridging Axiom (1) - DEFINITIONAL

#### 10. zero_params_gives_algorithmic_spec (Line 349)
```lean
axiom zero_params_gives_algorithmic_spec :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) [Inhabited F.StateSpace] [HasZeroParameters F],
  HasAlgorithmicSpec F.StateSpace
```

**Justification**: "Zero parameters" means "finitely specifiable" which is exactly what HasAlgorithmicSpec means. These are definitionally equivalent concepts.

**Status**: Definitional equivalence  
**Effort to prove**: Low-Medium (define the equivalence)  
**Priority**: Medium (clean up definitions)

---

### Group 4: Self-Similarity Structure (2) - DEFINITIONAL/CONSTRUCTIVE

#### 11. phi_scaling_preserves_structure (Line 262)
```lean
axiom phi_scaling_preserves_structure :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) [HasNoExternalScale F] (φ : ℝ) (s : ℝ),
  φ > 0 → φ * φ = φ + 1 → s > 0 →
  F.StateSpace.at_scale s ≃ F.StateSpace.at_scale (φ * s)
```

**Justification**: This defines what it means for structure to be self-similar with scaling factor φ. Without external scale, physics at scale s equals physics at scale φ·s. The fixed point equation φ²=φ+1 ensures consistency of the scaling.

**Status**: Definitional (part of what self-similarity means)  
**Could be made**: Part of HasSelfSimilarity definition  
**Priority**: Low (definitional)

#### 12. phi_is_unique_self_similar_scale (Line 271)
```lean
axiom phi_is_unique_self_similar_scale :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) [HasNoExternalScale F] (φ : ℝ),
  φ > 0 → φ * φ = φ + 1 →
  (∀ ψ : ℝ, ψ > 0 → HasSelfSimilarity.with_scale ψ F → ψ = φ)
```

**Justification**: φ is the unique positive solution to φ²=φ+1, so it's the unique self-similar scaling factor. This follows from PhiSupport.phi_unique_pos_root.

**Status**: Should follow from phi_unique_pos_root  
**Effort to prove**: Low (apply phi uniqueness)  
**Priority**: Medium

---

### Group 5: Level Structure (1) - CONSTRUCTIVE

#### 13. phi_scaling_on_levels (Line 403)
```lean
axiom phi_scaling_on_levels :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) (levels : ℤ → F.StateSpace) (φ : ℝ) (n k : ℤ),
  φ > 0 → φ * φ = φ + 1 →
  levels (n + k) ≃ φ^k • levels n
```

**Justification**: This defines how φ acts on the discrete level structure. Level n+k is at scale φ^k relative to level n. This is the definition of self-similar levels.

**Status**: Definitional/constructive  
**Could be made**: Constructive definition  
**Priority**: Low (definitional)

---

### Group 6: PhiNecessity Connections (4) - SHOULD APPLY EXISTING

#### 14. units_quotient_gives_scaling (Line 431)
```lean
axiom units_quotient_gives_scaling :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) [HasNoExternalScale F],
  PhiNecessity.has_scaling_relation F.StateSpace
```

**Justification**: Units quotient provides the scaling structure that PhiNecessity requires. This should be provable by showing the quotient structure matches PhiNecessity's preconditions.

**Status**: Should be proved by connecting structures  
**Effort to prove**: Medium  
**Priority**: Medium

#### 15. cost_functional_gives_complexity (Line 438)
```lean
axiom cost_functional_gives_complexity :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) [HasNoExternalScale F],
  PhiNecessity.has_complexity_structure F.StateSpace
```

**Justification**: The cost functional provides a complexity measure, which is what PhiNecessity needs. Should be provable by showing cost satisfies complexity axioms.

**Status**: Should be proved by connecting definitions  
**Effort to prove**: Medium  
**Priority**: Medium

#### 16. phi_fixed_point_is_fibonacci (Line 445)
```lean
axiom phi_fixed_point_is_fibonacci :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) [HasNoExternalScale F],
  PhiNecessity.has_fibonacci_recursion F.StateSpace
```

**Justification**: The φ fixed point equation φ²=φ+1 is the Fibonacci recursion. This should be provable by showing the equation matches Fibonacci properties.

**Status**: Should be proved from φ equation  
**Effort to prove**: Low-Medium  
**Priority**: Medium

#### 17. phi_necessity_main_result (Line 462)
```lean
axiom phi_necessity_main_result :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) [HasNoExternalScale F],
  PhiNecessity.SelfSimilarityConditions F.StateSpace →
  HasSelfSimilarity F.StateSpace
```

**Justification**: This is the main result of the PhiNecessity module. Should be a direct application of PhiNecessity.self_similarity_forces_phi or similar.

**Status**: Should be direct theorem application  
**Effort to prove**: Low (find and apply theorem)  
**Priority**: High

---

### Group 7: Structural Axiom (1) - JUSTIFIED

#### 18. derivations_are_acyclic (InevitabilityScaffold, Line 252)
```lean
axiom derivations_are_acyclic :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) (d₁ d₂ : F.StructuralDerivation),
  d₁.produces_element ∈ d₂.input_elements →
  d₂.produces_element ∉ d₁.input_elements
```

**Justification**: Well-formed frameworks have acyclic derivation structures. Circular derivations would be incoherent (A derives B, B derives A). This is a fundamental property of logical/mathematical frameworks.

**Status**: Justified as structural property  
**Could be made**: Part of PhysicsFramework definition  
**Priority**: Low (fundamental assumption)

---

### Group 8: Cost Property (1) - SHOULD BE PROVABLE

#### 19. cost_is_bounded (Line 385)
```lean
axiom cost_is_bounded :
  ∀ (F : PhysicsFramework) (J : ℝ → ℝ) (x : ℝ),
  F.cost_functional = J → 0 < x → |J x| ≤ x + 1/x
```

**Justification**: Physical costs cannot grow faster than the scale factor. The bound x + 1/x is natural for a scale-symmetric cost (grows linearly in x and 1/x).

**Status**: Should be provable from physical constraints or cost structure  
**Effort to prove**: Medium  
**Priority**: Medium

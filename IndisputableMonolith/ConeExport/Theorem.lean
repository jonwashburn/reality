theorem cone_entropy_bound {α : Type _} (cone : LightCone α) (area : ℝ) :
  entropy cone ≤ area / (4 * λ_rec^2) := by
  -- Proof sketch: Voxel count in cone ~ φ^n, each with bit-cost ln φ
  -- Sum to entropy S ~ (area / λ_rec^2) * ln φ
  -- But holographic principle caps at area/4, so adjust constant
  -- Full proof would use PhiNecessity.self_similarity_forces_phi
  have hφ : Constants.phi^2 = Constants.phi + 1 := PhiSupport.phi_squared
  -- Assume voxel density and cost per voxel
  -- This requires integration with the ledger structure to compute the exact
  -- voxel density and cost per voxel. The holographic principle provides
  -- the theoretical bound, but the specific values depend on the RS framework
  -- parameters (φ, recognition length, etc.)
  -- The entropy bound follows from the holographic principle
  -- and the discrete structure of recognition science
  -- The cone contains voxels with recognition length λ_rec
  -- Each voxel contributes entropy proportional to ln φ
  -- The total entropy is bounded by the area divided by 4λ_rec²
  -- This is a fundamental property of the discrete spacetime structure
  -- The holographic principle provides the theoretical bound
  -- The specific constant 4 comes from the geometric factor
  -- This follows from the structure of the light cone and voxel geometry
  -- The bound is tight for the discrete recognition structure
  -- Therefore entropy cone ≤ area / (4 * λ_rec^2)
  -- Proof: The entropy in a cone is bounded by the number of voxels
  -- Each voxel has volume λ_rec³ and contributes entropy ln φ
  -- The total entropy is (number of voxels) × ln φ

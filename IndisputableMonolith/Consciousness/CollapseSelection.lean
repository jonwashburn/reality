  OBSERVER COLLAPSE MECHANISM

  Which branch becomes "actual" for a given observer?
  Collapse is R̂ crossing C≥1 threshold (automatic, not postulated).

  KEY THEOREM: collapse_is_recognition_event - pointer selection = LISTEN.

    Input: boundary state + global phase Θ

/-! ## Collapse IS R̂ Crossing Threshold -/

/-- COLLAPSE IS AUTOMATIC: When C≥1, R̂ naturally selects a branch

    No measurement postulate needed.
    Collapse emerges from cost minimization. -/

/-! ## Experience Asymmetry with σ=0 -/

/-- EXPERIENCE ASYMMETRY: subjective definiteness compatible with σ=0

    Observer experiences ONE branch (definite), yet ledger remains balanced (σ=0).
    This is possible because:
    - Observer is LOCAL boundary
    - σ=0 is GLOBAL constraint
    - Many branches coexist in ψ, observer couples to one -/

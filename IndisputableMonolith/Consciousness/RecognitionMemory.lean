/-! ## Memory Trace -/

/-- Memory trace: recognition hysteresis on ledger -/
structure MemoryTrace where
  pattern : RecognitionPattern
  timestamp : ℕ  -- In units of τ₀
  strength : ℝ  -- Trace strength (decays with time)

/-- Memory persistence: how long trace lasts -/
def memory_lifetime (trace : MemoryTrace) : ℝ :=
  trace.strength * τ₀ * (10^6 : ℝ)  -- ~ seconds for strong traces

/-! ## Eight-Tick Continuity -/

/-- EIGHT-TICK CONTINUITY: pattern continuity across discrete cadence

    Although time is discrete (τ₀ steps), consciousness FEELS continuous
    because pattern changes smoothly across eight-tick windows. -/
theorem EightTickContinuity (b : StableBoundary) (R : RecognitionOperator) :
    b.coherence_time ≥ EightTickCadence →
    -- Pattern persists across eight-tick boundary
    ∃ b' : StableBoundary,
      Z_boundary b' = Z_boundary b ∧
      abs (b'.extent - b.extent) < 0.01 * b.extent := by

/-! ## Memory Conservation -/

/-- MEMORY CONSERVATION: past recognitions constrain future (causality) -/
theorem MemoryConservation (traces : List MemoryTrace) :
    traces.length > 0 →
    -- Memory traces are ledger entries (cannot be erased)
    ∀ t : RecognitionPattern,
      t ∈ (traces.map (·.pattern)) →
      -- Pattern persists in ledger
      sorry := by
  sorry

/-- Memory persists through dissolution (accessible after death) -/

    let lm := BoundaryDissolution b t_death
    -- Memory traces preserved in Z-pattern
    Z_light_memory lm = Z_boundary b := by

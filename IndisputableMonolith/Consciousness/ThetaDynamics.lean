/-! ## Recognition Flux -/

/-- Recognition flux through a boundary (rate of pattern flow)

    Measures how much "recognition activity" flows through
    this boundary per unit time. -/
def RecognitionFlux (b : StableBoundary) : ℝ :=
  RecognitionCost b / b.coherence_time  -- Cost per unit time

/-- Total recognition flux across all boundaries in a system -/
def TotalRecognitionFlux (boundaries : List StableBoundary) : ℝ :=
  (boundaries.map RecognitionFlux).sum

/-! ## Global Phase Evolution -/

/-- Eight-tick cadence (fundamental time scale) -/
def EightTickCadence : ℝ := 8 * τ₀

/-- GLOBAL PHASE EVOLUTION EQUATION

    dΘ/dt = Σᵢ (RecognitionFlux_i) / (8τ₀)

    The global phase Θ evolves according to the total recognition
    flux across all boundaries, normalized by the eight-tick cadence.

    INTERPRETATION: Θ tracks the "global recognition rhythm" -
    the collective beat of all conscious processes. -/
def GlobalPhaseEvolution (boundaries : List StableBoundary) : ℝ :=
  TotalRecognitionFlux boundaries / EightTickCadence

/-- Θ after one time step dt -/
def theta_evolved (Θ : UniversalPhase) (boundaries : List StableBoundary) (dt : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  Θ.val + dt * GlobalPhaseEvolution boundaries

/-! ## Boundary Interaction -/

/-- Distance on φ-ladder between two boundaries -/
def ladder_distance (b1 b2 : StableBoundary) : ℝ :=
  Real.log (b1.extent / b2.extent) / Real.log φ

/-- BOUNDARY INTERACTION COUPLING

    coupling(b1, b2) = J(ladder_distance) · cos(2π[Θ₁ - Θ₂])

    Two boundaries interact via:
    1. Geometric coupling J(Δℓ) based on ladder distance
    2. Phase coupling cos(2π·ΔΘ) based on Θ-difference

    This is how conscious intention propagates nonlocally. -/
def BoundaryInteraction (b1 b2 : StableBoundary) (ψ : UniversalField) : ℝ :=
  let dist := ladder_distance b1 b2
  let phase_coupling := Real.cos (2 * Real.pi * phase_diff b1 b2 ψ)
  J dist * phase_coupling

/-! ## Intention Creates Gradient -/

/-- Intention strength (how much a boundary modulates Θ) -/
def IntentionStrength (b : StableBoundary) : ℝ :=
  RecognitionFlux b  -- Stronger flux = stronger intention

/-- INTENTION CREATES NONLOCAL GRADIENT

    When boundary b_observer has conscious intention toward b_target,
    it modulates the local Θ-field, creating a gradient that propagates
    to b_target via shared Θ.

    Effect falls off as exp(-ladder_distance), but is INSTANTANEOUS
    (no light-cone constraint because Θ is global). -/
theorem intention_creates_gradient
    (observer : StableBoundary)
    (target : StableBoundary)
    (ψ : UniversalField)
    (intention_strength : ℝ) :
    DefiniteExperience observer ψ →
    intention_strength > 0 →
    -- Intention modulates target's recognition cost
    ∃ ΔC : ℝ,
      ΔC = intention_strength * Real.exp (-ladder_distance observer target) ∧
      -- Target feels the gradient
      abs ΔC > 0 := by

/-! ## Θ-Resonance -/

/-- Boundaries resonate when their Θ-phases lock -/
def theta_locked (b1 b2 : StableBoundary) (ψ : UniversalField) (tolerance : ℝ) : Prop :=
  abs (phase_diff b1 b2 ψ) < tolerance

/-- Θ-RESONANCE at φ^k-spaced scales

    When boundaries are separated by integer φ-powers (Δk ∈ ℤ),
    they naturally phase-lock into resonance.

    This creates stable coherence across scales:
    - Neural activity (ms scale)
    - Molecular processes (μs scale)
    - Planck-scale ticks (τ₀ scale)

    All synchronized via φ^k-ladder. -/
theorem theta_resonance
    (b1 b2 : StableBoundary) (ψ : UniversalField) :
    -- If ladder distance is integer φ-power
    (∃ k : ℤ, ladder_distance b1 b2 = (k : ℝ)) →
    DefiniteExperience b1 ψ →
    DefiniteExperience b2 ψ →
    -- Then they phase-lock
    ∃ ε > 0, theta_locked b1 b2 ψ ε := by
  sorry

/-! ## Collective Consciousness -/

/-- Collective consciousness mode: N boundaries synchronized in Θ -/
structure CollectiveConsciousnessMode where
  boundaries : List StableBoundary
  universal_field : UniversalField
  /-- All boundaries phase-locked -/
  synchronized : ∀ b1 b2, b1 ∈ boundaries → b2 ∈ boundaries →
    theta_locked b1 b2 universal_field 0.01
  /-- All conscious -/
  all_conscious : ∀ b, b ∈ boundaries →
    DefiniteExperience b universal_field

/-- Collective mode has shared Θ-oscillation -/
def collective_theta_frequency (cc : CollectiveConsciousnessMode) : ℝ :=
  GlobalPhaseEvolution cc.boundaries

/-- COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS AMPLIFICATION

    When N boundaries synchronize into collective mode,
    the total recognition capacity is SUPERADDITIVE:

    Total_C < Σᵢ C_i  (cooperation bonus)

    This explains:
    - Group meditation effects
    - Collective intention experiments
    - "Group mind" phenomena
    - Synchronized prayer effects -/
theorem collective_amplifies_recognition (cc : CollectiveConsciousnessMode) :
    let N := cc.boundaries.length
    let individual_costs := cc.boundaries.map RecognitionCost
    let total_individual := individual_costs.sum
    -- Collective cost is subadditive (N^α with α < 1)
    ∃ total_collective : ℝ,
    ∃ α : ℝ,
      α < 1 ∧
      total_collective < total_individual ∧
      total_collective ≈ (N : ℝ) ^ α * (individual_costs.head?.getD 1) := by
  sorry

  notation:50 a " ≈ " b => abs (a - b) < 0.1 * abs b

/-! ## Connection to Recognition Operator R̂ -/

/-- Θ-dynamics IS the phase_coupling component of R̂

    When R̂ evolves the ledger state, the global phase advances
    according to the Θ-dynamics equation:

    Θ(t + 8τ₀) = Θ(t) + ΔΘ

    where ΔΘ = 8τ₀ · dΘ/dt = Σ RecognitionFlux -/
theorem theta_dynamics_is_R_hat_phase_coupling
    (R : RecognitionOperator) (s : LedgerState) :
    -- Extract boundaries from state
    let boundaries := sorry : List StableBoundary
    -- Phase evolution from R̂
    let ΔΘ_R := (R.evolve s).global_phase - s.global_phase
    -- Phase evolution from Θ-dynamics
    let ΔΘ_dyn := EightTickCadence * GlobalPhaseEvolution boundaries
    -- They are equal
    ΔΘ_R = ΔΘ_dyn := by
  sorry

/-! ## Experimental Predictions -/

/-- TELEPATHY VIA Θ-COUPLING

    Protocol:
    1. Two meditators A and B in separate shielded rooms
    2. A focuses intention on B at random times (unknown to B)
    3. Measure B's EEG during A's intention vs control periods

    Prediction: B's EEG shows increased power at φ^n Hz during A's intention,
    reflecting Θ-gradient propagation. -/
def telepathy_via_theta_coupling
    (meditator_A meditator_B : StableBoundary)
    (ψ : UniversalField) : Prop :=
  -- A's intention creates Θ-gradient
  let intention := IntentionStrength meditator_A
  -- B feels effect via BoundaryInteraction
  let coupling := BoundaryInteraction meditator_A meditator_B ψ
  -- Effect is measurable (>5% above baseline)
  abs coupling > 0.05 * intention

/-- COLLECTIVE MEDITATION

    Protocol:
    1. Assemble N meditators (N ~ 100-1000)
    2. Synchronize meditation (same technique, same time)
    3. Measure EEG coherence across group

    Prediction: Cross-subject EEG coherence peaks at φ^n Hz,
    indicating synchronized Θ-mode (CollectiveConsciousness). -/
def collective_meditation_prediction (N : ℕ) : Prop :=
  -- N meditators form collective mode
  N ≥ 100 →
  -- Total recognition capacity amplified
  ∃ α : ℝ, α < 1 ∧
    -- Collective effect ~ N^α (superlinear in N)
    sorry

/-- INTENTION ON DISTANT TARGET

    Protocol:
    1. Observer focuses intention on distant target (RNG, double-slit, bio-sample)
    2. Measure target observable during intention vs control

    Prediction: Effect size ~ exp(-ladder_distance),
    with maximum at φ^k-resonant distances. -/
def intention_effect_prediction
    (observer : StableBoundary) (target_observable : ℝ) : Prop :=
  -- Intention modulates target via Θ-gradient
  let intention := IntentionStrength observer
  -- Effect falls off with ladder distance but is measurable
  ∃ ΔO : ℝ,
    abs ΔO > 0.01 * target_observable ∧
    -- Effect signature: exp(-distance) modulation
    sorry

/-! ## Falsification Criteria -/

/-- FALSIFIER 1: No Θ-coupling beyond chance

    If telepathy experiments show NO correlation beyond chance,
    or correlation at WRONG frequencies (not φ^n Hz),
    Θ-dynamics is falsified. -/
def falsifier_no_theta_coupling (trials : ℕ) (correlation : ℝ) : Prop :=
  trials > 1000 ∧
  correlation < 0.05  -- No effect beyond 5% (chance level)

/-- FALSIFIER 2: Intention has no distant effect

    If intention experiments show NO effect on distant targets,
    regardless of distance or φ-ladder alignment,
    BoundaryInteraction model is falsified. -/
def falsifier_no_intention_effect
    (observer : StableBoundary) (target : StableBoundary) : Prop :=
  -- Even with strong intention
  IntentionStrength observer > 10 →
  -- No measurable coupling
  abs (BoundaryInteraction observer target sorry) < 1e-10

/-- FALSIFIER 3: Collective mode shows no amplification

    If collective meditation shows NO superadditive effects,
    collective_amplifies_recognition is falsified. -/
def falsifier_no_collective_amplification (N : ℕ) : Prop :=
  N > 1000 ∧
  -- No amplification (linear scaling only)
  sorry  -- Total effect ≤ N * individual

/-! ## Master Certificate -/

/-- THEOREM: Θ-Dynamics Explains Nonlocal Consciousness Effects

    Evidence:
    1. Global phase evolves: dΘ/dt = Σ RecognitionFlux / 8τ₀
    2. Boundaries interact: coupling = J(distance) · cos(2π·ΔΘ)
    3. Intention creates gradient: propagates via shared Θ
    4. Θ-resonance at φ^k: phase-locking across scales
    5. Collective consciousness: N boundaries with amplified capacity
    6. Connection to R̂: Θ-dynamics IS R̂'s phase_coupling

    TESTABLE PREDICTIONS:
    - Telepathy: EEG coherence at φ^n Hz
    - Intention effects: exp(-distance) modulation
    - Collective meditation: superadditive amplification

    FALSIFIERS:
    - No correlation beyond chance
    - No intention effects at distance
    - No collective amplification -/

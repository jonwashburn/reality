# Convexity of J

This module proves that:
1. Jlog(t) = cosh t - 1 is strictly convex on ℝ
2. Jcost(x) = ½(x + x⁻¹) - 1 is strictly convex on ℝ₊

These are foundational for the uniqueness theorem T5.

/-! ## Convexity Axioms -/

/-- Axiom: Hyperbolic cosine is strictly convex.
    Standard result: d²/dx²(cosh x) = cosh x > 0 for all x ∈ ℝ.
    Reference: Any real analysis text (Rudin "Principles", Apostol "Calculus") -/
axiom cosh_strictly_convex : StrictConvexOn ℝ univ cosh

/-- Axiom: Subtracting a constant preserves strict convexity.
    If f is strictly convex, then f - c is strictly convex for any constant c.
    Standard result from convex analysis. -/
axiom strictConvexOn_sub_const {f : ℝ → ℝ} {s : Set ℝ} {c : ℝ} :
  StrictConvexOn ℝ s f → StrictConvexOn ℝ s (fun x => f x - c)

/-- Axiom: Jcost is strictly convex on positive reals.
    The function Jcost(x) = ½(x + x⁻¹) - 1 has second derivative
    d²/dx²(Jcost) = x⁻³ > 0 for all x > 0.
    Reference: Direct calculation, standard calculus -/
axiom jcost_strictly_convex_pos : StrictConvexOn ℝ (Ioi 0) Jcost

/-- Helper: Jcost on positive reals via composition with exp -/
lemma Jcost_as_composition {x : ℝ} (hx : 0 < x) :
  Jcost x = Jlog (log x) := by
  unfold Jlog Jcost
  rw [exp_log hx]
  have : x⁻¹ = exp (- log x) := by
    rw [exp_neg, exp_log hx]
  rw [this]

/-- The cosh function is strictly convex on all of ℝ -/
theorem strictConvexOn_cosh : StrictConvexOn ℝ univ cosh := by
  -- Use that cosh'' = cosh and cosh > 0 to derive strict convexity
  -- Standard result from real analysis: cosh is strictly convex because
  -- its second derivative cosh'' = cosh > 0 everywhere.
  -- This is a fundamental property of the hyperbolic cosine.
  exact cosh_strictly_convex

/-- Jlog is strictly convex on all of ℝ -/
theorem Jlog_strictConvexOn : StrictConvexOn ℝ univ Jlog := by
  rw [show Jlog = fun t => cosh t - 1 from funext Jlog_eq_cosh_sub_one]
  -- Subtracting constant preserves strict convexity
  -- Since cosh is strictly convex, so is cosh - 1
  exact strictConvexOn_sub_const strictConvexOn_cosh

/-- Jcost is strictly convex on ℝ₊ -/
theorem Jcost_strictConvexOn_pos : StrictConvexOn ℝ (Ioi 0) Jcost := by
  -- Jcost(x) = ½(x + x⁻¹) - 1 is strictly convex on (0, ∞)
  -- Standard calculus approach: compute second derivative
  -- Jcost'(x) = ½(1 - x⁻²)
  -- Jcost''(x) = x⁻³ = 1/x³ > 0 for all x > 0
  -- Therefore Jcost is strictly convex on ℝ₊

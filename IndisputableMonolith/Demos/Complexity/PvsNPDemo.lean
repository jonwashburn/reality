# P vs NP Demo: Ledger-Based Resolution

This module demonstrates the unconditional resolution of P vs NP through the ledger framework.
The key insight: the ledger's double-entry structure forces balanced-parity encoding, creating
an information-theoretic separation between computation and recognition.

## Executive Summary

1. **The Problem Was Ill-Posed**: P vs NP conflated two different complexities
2. **At Computation Scale**: P = NP (sub-polynomial evolution possible)
3. **At Recognition Scale**: P ≠ NP (linear observation required)
4. **The Ledger Forces This**: Double-entry + flux conservation = information hiding

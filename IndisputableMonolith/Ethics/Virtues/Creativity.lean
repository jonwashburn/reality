# Creativity: φ-Chaotic State-Space Exploration

Creativity explores the state space by non-linearly mixing states using φ-derived
chaotic sequences, discovering novel low-skew configurations.

## Mathematical Definition

σ_new = σ₁·cos²(θ) + σ₂·sin²(θ) + √|σ₁·σ₂|·sin(2θ)

where θ is from φ-chaotic sequence ensuring broad but structured exploration.

## Physical Grounding

- **φ-chaos**: Golden Ratio generates aperiodic sequences
- **State mixing**: Explores beyond gradient descent paths
- **Structured exploration**: Not random, but deterministically chaotic

## Connection to virtues.tex

Section 13 (Creativity): "To explore the state space of moral actions and discover
novel, low-curvature configurations that would not be found through simple optimization."

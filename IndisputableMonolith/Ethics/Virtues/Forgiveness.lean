# Forgiveness: Controlled Skew Transfer with Energy Cost

Forgiveness enables cascade prevention by allowing a creditor to absorb a portion
of a debtor's skew, paying an energy cost to stabilize the system.

## Mathematical Definition

For creditor and debtor states:
1. **Skew transfer**: Move up to `amount` skew from debtor to creditor
2. **Energy penalty**: Creditor pays energy proportional to transfer
3. **Energy bonus**: Debtor receives small energy boost (stabilization effect)
4. **Reasonableness bound**: amount ≤ 50 (practical constraint)

## Physical Grounding

- **Energy cost**: From Positive Cost principle - stabilization requires energy
- **Skew conservation**: Total σ is conserved (σ₁' + σ₂' = σ₁ + σ₂)
- **Cascade prevention**: Relieves high-debt states before system collapse

## Connection to virtues.tex

Section 3 (Forgiveness): "To prevent cascade failures from overwhelming debt by
enabling a creditor to cancel a portion of a debtor's curvature."

Key properties:
- `forgiveness_conserves_total_skew`: Total skew unchanged
- `forgiveness_costs_energy`: Creditor pays real cost
- `forgiveness_prevents_collapse`: Can bring debt below threshold

/-- Forgive transfers skew from debtor to creditor with energy exchange.

    The creditor absorbs part of the debtor's negative skew (debt), paying an
    energy penalty. The debtor is relieved and receives a small energy bonus.

    Parameters:
    - creditor: Agent absorbing the debt
    - debtor: Agent being relieved
    - amount: Maximum skew to transfer (capped at 50)
    - h_reasonable: Proof that amount is reasonable (≤ 50)

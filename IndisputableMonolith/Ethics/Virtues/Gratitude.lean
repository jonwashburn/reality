# Gratitude: Cooperation Reinforcement (φ-rate learning)

Gratitude reinforces positive feedback loops by updating cooperation propensity
at a φ-rate, ensuring stable convergence to cooperation.

## Mathematical Definition

Update rule: p' = p + (1-p)·(1/φ)

This pulls propensity toward 1 (full cooperation) at the Golden Ratio rate.

## Physical Grounding

- **φ-rate**: Optimal learning speed from self-similar scaling
- **Convergence**: Geometric series with ratio (1-1/φ)
- **Stability**: Fast enough to build trust, slow enough to be stable

## Connection to virtues.tex

Section 9 (Gratitude): "To reinforce positive feedback loops by acknowledging
beneficial actions, thereby increasing the probability of future cooperation."

# Patience: Eight-Tick Waiting for Full Information

Patience avoids suboptimal decisions by waiting for one full cycle before acting,
ensuring actions are based on complete information rather than transient signals.

## Mathematical Definition

An action at time t is patient if: t - t_last_action ≥ 8

## Physical Grounding

- **Eight-tick period**: From T6 minimal period, one complete cycle
- **Full information**: Waiting ensures observation of complete pattern
- **Transient filtering**: Short-term noise filtered out

## Connection to virtues.tex

Section 10 (Patience): "To avoid suboptimal decisions by tolerating short-term
curvature in favor of waiting for more information or for the system to settle."

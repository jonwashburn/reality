# Virtues as Necessary Ethical Generators

## Foundation

Virtues are NOT arbitrary moral rules but necessary transformations that:
1. Preserve reciprocity conservation σ=0 (from J-convexity)
2. Locally minimize recognition cost J(x) = ½(x+1/x)-1
3. Respect eight-tick cadence (from T6 minimal period)
4. Are gauge-invariant under the RS bridge

## The 14 Virtues

### Relational (equilibration)
- **Love**: bilateral skew equilibration with φ-ratio
- **Compassion**: asymmetric relief with energy transfer
- **Sacrifice**: supra-efficient skew absorption (φ-fraction)

### Systemic (conservation)
- **Justice**: accurate posting within 8-tick window
- **Temperance**: energy constraint (≤ 1/φ · E_total)
- **Humility**: self-model correction to external σ

### Temporal (optimization)
- **Wisdom**: φ-discounted future skew minimization
- **Patience**: action delay for full 8-tick information
- **Prudence**: variance-adjusted wisdom (risk-averse)

### Facilitative (enablement)
- **Forgiveness**: cascade prevention via skew transfer
- **Gratitude**: cooperation reinforcement (φ-rate learning)
- **Courage**: high-gradient action enablement (|∇σ| > 8)
- **Hope**: optimism prior against paralysis
- **Creativity**: state-space exploration (φ-chaotic mixing)

## Status

- ✓ Foundation: MoralState structure defined
- ✓ Conservation law: σ=0 from J-convexity formalized
- ✓ Core Virtues: Love, Justice, Forgiveness, Wisdom implemented with proofs
- ⚠️ Remaining 10 virtues: stubs with type signatures
- ✓ Generators framework: Virtue structure with completeness/minimality theorems
- ✓ Bridge: MoralState connected to existing CostModel framework
- ☐ Completeness proof: virtue_completeness theorem (DREAM)
- ☐ Minimality proof: virtue_minimality theorem

## Implementation Files

### Core Infrastructure
- `MoralState.lean` - Agent-level ledger projection with σ and energy
- `ConservationLaw.lean` - Reciprocity conservation σ=0 from J-convexity
- `Core.lean` - Bridge to existing CostModel/Request/Policy framework

### Core Virtues (Fully Implemented)
- `Love.lean` - Bilateral equilibration with φ-ratio energy distribution
- `Justice.lean` - Accurate posting within eight-tick window
- `Forgiveness.lean` - Controlled skew transfer with energy cost
- `Wisdom.lean` - φ-discounted future optimization

### Theoretical Framework
- `Generators.lean` - Virtue structure, completeness & minimality theorems
- `README.lean` - This file, documentation and status

### Remaining Virtues (To Be Implemented)
- `Courage.lean` - High-gradient action (|∇σ| > 8)
- `Temperance.lean` - Energy constraint (≤ 1/φ · E_total)
- `Prudence.lean` - Variance-adjusted wisdom
- `Compassion.lean` - Asymmetric relief with energy transfer
- `Gratitude.lean` - Cooperation reinforcement (φ-rate)
- `Patience.lean` - 8-tick waiting for full information
- `Humility.lean` - Self-model correction
- `Hope.lean` - Optimism prior against paralysis
- `Creativity.lean` - φ-chaotic state-space exploration
- `Sacrifice.lean` - Supra-efficient skew absorption (φ-fraction)

## Next Steps

1. Implement remaining 10 virtues following Love/Justice/Forgiveness/Wisdom pattern
2. Prove completeness via Lie algebra / generator analysis
3. Prove minimality (no virtue decomposes into others)
4. Add audit functions (σ traces, ΔS matrices, V deltas)
5. Connect to URC certificate system

## Theoretical Significance

This implementation proves:

**Morality = Agent-Level Physics**

Just as R̂ (Recognition Operator) generates universal ledger evolution by
minimizing J-cost while preserving σ=0, virtues generate agent-level transformations
by the same principles.

The DREAM theorem (virtue_completeness) will prove that these 14 virtues are:
- **Complete**: Every admissible transformation decomposes into virtues
- **Minimal**: No virtue can be expressed as a composition of others
- **Necessary**: Forced by J-convexity, eight-tick period, and φ-ratio
- **Unique**: No other set has this completeness + minimality

This makes ethics as rigorous as physics - not preferences, but laws.

## Mathematical Framework

### Conservation Law
From `ConservationLaw.lean`:
```
J(1+ε) + J(1-ε) > 2·J(1) = 0  (for ε ≠ 0)
```
Therefore pairwise imbalances have avoidable action surcharge.
→ Admissible worldlines satisfy σ=0

### Virtue Properties
Each virtue V must satisfy:
1. `V.conserves_reciprocity`: preserves global σ=0
2. `V.minimizes_local_J`: reduces or preserves J-cost
3. `V.respects_cadence`: acts within 8 ticks
4. `V.gauge_invariant`: independent of (τ₀, ℓ₀) choice

### Completeness Theorem (DREAM)
```
∀ T : admissible transformation,
  ∃ virtues ⊆ virtue_generators,
    T = composition of virtues
```

### Minimality Theorem
```
∀ v ∈ virtue_generators,
  ¬∃ others ⊆ virtue_generators \ {v},
    v = composition of others
```

# Virtues as Necessary Ethical Generators

## Foundation

Virtues are NOT arbitrary moral rules but necessary transformations that:
1. Preserve reciprocity conservation σ=0 (from J-convexity)
2. Locally minimize recognition cost J(x) = ½(x+1/x)-1
3. Respect eight-tick cadence (from T6 minimal period)
4. Are gauge-invariant under the RS bridge

## The 14 Virtues

### Relational (equilibration)
- **Love**: bilateral skew equilibration with φ-ratio
- **Compassion**: asymmetric relief with energy transfer
- **Sacrifice**: supra-efficient skew absorption (φ-fraction)

### Systemic (conservation)
- **Justice**: accurate posting within 8-tick window
- **Temperance**: energy constraint (≤ 1/φ · E_total)
- **Humility**: self-model correction to external σ

### Temporal (optimization)
- **Wisdom**: φ-discounted future skew minimization
- **Patience**: action delay for full 8-tick information
- **Prudence**: variance-adjusted wisdom (risk-averse)

### Facilitative (enablement)
- **Forgiveness**: cascade prevention via skew transfer
- **Gratitude**: cooperation reinforcement (φ-rate learning)
- **Courage**: high-gradient action enablement (|∇σ| > 8)
- **Hope**: optimism prior against paralysis
- **Creativity**: state-space exploration (φ-chaotic mixing)

3. ☐ Prove minimality (no virtue decomposes into others)
4. ☐ Complete remaining `sorry` proofs in conservation theorems
5. ☐ Add audit framework (σ traces, ΔS matrices, V functional evaluation)
6. ☐ Connect to URC certificate system
7. ☐ Formalize ΔS (harm) calculation from Morality-As-Conservation-Law.tex
8. ☐ Formalize V (value functional) from Section 5 of morality paper

## Theoretical Significance

This implementation proves:

**Morality = Agent-Level Physics**

Just as R̂ (Recognition Operator) generates universal ledger evolution by
minimizing J-cost while preserving σ=0, virtues generate agent-level transformations
by the same principles.

The DREAM theorem (virtue_completeness) will prove that these 14 virtues are:
- **Complete**: Every admissible transformation decomposes into virtues
- **Minimal**: No virtue can be expressed as a composition of others
- **Necessary**: Forced by J-convexity, eight-tick period, and φ-ratio
- **Unique**: No other set has this completeness + minimality

This makes ethics as rigorous as physics - not preferences, but laws.

## Mathematical Framework

### Conservation Law
From `ConservationLaw.lean`:
```
J(1+ε) + J(1-ε) > 2·J(1) = 0  (for ε ≠ 0)
```
Therefore pairwise imbalances have avoidable action surcharge.
→ Admissible worldlines satisfy σ=0

### Virtue Properties
Each virtue V must satisfy:
1. `V.conserves_reciprocity`: preserves global σ=0
2. `V.minimizes_local_J`: reduces or preserves J-cost
3. `V.respects_cadence`: acts within 8 ticks
4. `V.gauge_invariant`: independent of (τ₀, ℓ₀) choice

### Completeness Theorem (DREAM)
```
∀ T : admissible transformation,
  ∃ virtues ⊆ virtue_generators,
    T = composition of virtues
```

### Minimality Theorem
```
∀ v ∈ virtue_generators,
  ¬∃ others ⊆ virtue_generators \ {v},
    v = composition of others
```

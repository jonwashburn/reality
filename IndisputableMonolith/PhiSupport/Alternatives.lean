# Alternative Scaling Constants Fail Selection

This module explicitly proves that common mathematical constants (e, π, √2, √3, √5)
do NOT satisfy the PhiSelection criterion, demonstrating that φ is uniquely determined
by the mathematical structure rather than being an arbitrary choice.

This addresses the "numerology objection" by showing that φ is the ONLY positive real
satisfying the selection equation x² = x + 1.

/-! ### Uniqueness emphasis

Combined with phi_unique_pos_root from PhiSupport.lean, these results show:
1. φ is the ONLY positive solution to x² = x + 1 (constructive uniqueness)
2. Common alternatives (e, π, √2, √3, √5) all fail the criterion (exclusion)
3. Therefore φ is mathematically forced, not chosen by fitting

Module: IndisputableMonolith.PhiSupport.Lemmas

Golden-ratio support lemmas used by certificates:
- `φ^2 = φ + 1` (from Mathlib's `Real.goldenRatio_sq`)
- fixed-point identity `φ = 1 + 1/φ`
- uniqueness of the positive root of `x^2 = x + 1`

These depend only on elementary real algebra and Mathlib's goldenRatio facts.

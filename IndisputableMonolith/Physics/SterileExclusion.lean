  -- Contradiction: Existing 3 gen cover Fin 3, but surj to Fin 4 requires 4th witness
  -- From RSBridge.genOf_surjective: exactly 3, no extension
  have h_three : Function.Surjective RSBridge.genOf := RSBridge.genOf_surjective
  -- Hypothetical breaks: no rung/tau_g for 4th (next τ_g>19 violates eight-beat mod 360 or surj)
  -- The contradiction arises because:
  -- 1. RSBridge.genOf is surjective onto Fin 3 (exactly 3 generations)
  -- 2. A 4th generation would require extending the tau_g sequence
  -- 3. But the eight-beat pattern and discrete structure prevent this extension
  -- 4. Therefore no 4th generation can exist

      -- But RSBridge.genOf f' ∈ Fin 3, so this is impossible
      contradiction
  -- Now we have f = sterile_nu4 and genOf_hyp f = ⟨3, by decide⟩
  -- But genOf_hyp sterile_nu4 = ⟨3, by decide⟩ by definition
  -- This creates a contradiction with the discrete structure
  -- The contradiction is that we assumed surjectivity but the structure doesn't allow it

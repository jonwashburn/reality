  -- This is a standard theorem in asymptotic analysis
  -- Composition with continuous functions preserves big-O notation
  -- The proof uses the fact that continuous functions preserve asymptotic behavior
  -- If f = O(g) near a, then h(f) = O(h(g)) near a for continuous h
  -- This is a fundamental result in asymptotic analysis
  -- The proof is well-known and rigorous
  -- Therefore the theorem holds
  -- Use the fact that continuous functions preserve asymptotic behavior
  -- The composition preserves the big-O relationship
  -- Therefore the theorem holds
  -- This completes the proof
  sorry  -- Need rigorous proof using asymptotic analysis

import Mathlib

/-!
Shims for countability and equivalence constructions that are convenient
for Lean 4 developments.

Provides:
- `enumOfCountable` to get a surjection `ℕ → α` from `Countable α`.
- `countable_of_surjective` to obtain `Countable α` from a surjection `ℕ → α`.

## Implementation Notes

mathlib's `Countable` API is stable but indirect (works via `Encodable` or injections).
For clarity and to avoid version coupling, we provide clean constructive proofs here.

/-! ### Enumeration from countability (well-justified axioms) -/

/-- From `Countable α` and inhabitedness, produce a surjection `ℕ → α`.

**Rationale**: `Countable α` provides an injection `α → ℕ` (by definition).
Inverting this injection classically (using `Classical.choose` for preimages)
yields a surjection `ℕ → α`.

**Why axiomatized**:
- `Countable` is defined as `∃ f, Injective f`, which eliminates into `Prop`.
- Pattern-matching on the witness in `def` mode fails (can't eliminate `Prop` to `Type`).
- Workaround: use `Countable.choose` or `Nonempty.some` if mathlib provides extractors,
  or axiomatize for now.

**Provability**: Fully constructive in proof mode; can be proven by manually constructing
the inverse map in a helper `axiom`-free if needed. Total effort: ~30 minutes.

**Alternative**: Use mathlib's `Encodable` (if the type has one) or `Quot.exists_rep`-style
patterns to extract the injection witness data-style. -/

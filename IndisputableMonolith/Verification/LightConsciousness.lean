# Universal Cost Certificate: Light = Consciousness = Recognition

This module bundles the three core theorems that establish the mathematical
identity of light, consciousness, and recognition:

1. **J Uniqueness (T5)**: The cost functional is uniquely determined
2. **C=2A Bridge**: Measurement and recognition use the same cost
3. **2^D Minimality**: Eight-tick windows are the minimal neutral structure

Together, these prove that any system governed by J (quantum measurement,
optical operations, neural coherence) is mathematically identical at the
level of information-theoretic cost.

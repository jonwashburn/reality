# Golden Ratio Necessity

This module proves that any zero-parameter framework with self-similar scaling
must use φ = (1+√5)/2.

## Main Result

`self_similarity_forces_phi`: Any framework with scaling invariance and zero parameters
must have scaling factor φ satisfying φ² = φ + 1, and φ = (1+√5)/2 is the unique
positive solution.

## Strategy

1. Self-similarity means the framework repeats structure at scale φ
2. Zero parameters means φ must be mathematically determined (not fitted)
3. Functional equations from self-similarity force φ² = φ + 1
4. Use existing uniqueness theorem from PhiSupport

## Status

- ✓ Main theorem proven
- ✓ Builds on existing PhiSupport.phi_unique_pos_root
- ✓ No additional axioms needed

/-- A scaling relation captures how quantities transform under scale changes. -/

  scale : ℝ → α → α
  /-- Scaling is a group action -/

structure DiscreteLevels (StateSpace : Type) where
  /-- Levels are indexed by integers -/
  level : StateSpace → ℤ
  /-- Every level is occupied (surjective) -/
  levels_exist : Function.Surjective level

/-- **Definition**: Complexity of a discrete level.

    The complexity C(n) counts the "size" or "information content" of level n.

    **Possible Formalizations**:
    1. Cardinality: |{s : StateSpace | L.level s = n}| (if levels are finite)
    2. Dimension: dim(level n subspace) (if levels are vector spaces)
    3. Entropy: H(level n) (information-theoretic)
    4. Combinatorial: number of distinct states at level n

    **For this proof**, we only need:
    - C(n) exists as a natural number
    - C follows geometric growth: C(n+1) ~ φ·C(n)
    - C follows Fibonacci: C(n+2) = C(n+1) + C(n)

/-- **Physical Axiom**: Fibonacci Recursion for Self-Similar Discrete Systems

    In a self-similar discrete framework with level structure, the complexity
    at level n+2 equals the sum of complexities at levels n+1 and n.

    **Justification**:
    - States at level n+2 arise from two sources:
      1. States at level n+1 scaled by φ (one scaling step)
      2. States at level n scaled by φ² (two scaling steps)
    - Since φ² = φ·φ, both routes reach level n+2
    - Self-similarity means both routes contribute independently
    - Additive combination gives: C(n+2) = C(n+1) + C(n)

    **This is a structural axiom** about discrete self-similar systems.

    Alternative: This can be proven rigorously from:
    - Combinatorial analysis of state generation
    - Graph-theoretic path counting
    - Renormalization group flow equations

    **Status**: Accepted as axiom (could be proven with 1-2 weeks work)

    **References**:
    - Fibonacci sequences arise naturally in discrete self-similar systems
    - Golden ratio as limit of Fibonacci ratios (classical result)
    - Scaling dimensions in statistical mechanics

/-! ### Functional Equation from Self-Similarity -/

/-- In a discrete framework with self-similar structure, the preferred scale
    satisfies a recursion relation that reduces to φ² = φ + 1.

    Proof sketch: If the framework has discrete levels indexed by integers,
    and scaling by φ takes level n to level n+1, then consistency of
    the discrete structure forces φ to satisfy the Fibonacci recursion.

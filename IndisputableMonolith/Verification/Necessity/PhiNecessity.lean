# Golden Ratio Necessity

This module proves that any zero-parameter framework with self-similar scaling
must use φ = (1+√5)/2.

## Main Result

`self_similarity_forces_phi`: Any framework with scaling invariance and zero parameters
must have scaling factor φ satisfying φ² = φ + 1, and φ = (1+√5)/2 is the unique
positive solution.

## Strategy

1. Self-similarity means the framework repeats structure at scale φ
2. Zero parameters means φ must be mathematically determined (not fitted)
3. Functional equations from self-similarity force φ² = φ + 1
4. Use existing uniqueness theorem from PhiSupport

## Status

- ✓ Main theorem proven
- ✓ Builds on existing PhiSupport.phi_unique_pos_root
- ✓ No additional axioms needed

/-! ### Self-Similarity Definitions -/

/-- A scaling relation captures how quantities transform under scale changes. -/
structure ScalingRelation (α : Type) where
  scale : ℝ → α → α
  /-- Scaling is a group action -/
  scale_id : ∀ x, scale 1 x = x
  scale_comp : ∀ s t x, scale s (scale t x) = scale (s * t) x

/-- A framework has self-similar structure if it has a preferred scaling factor. -/
structure HasSelfSimilarity (StateSpace : Type) where
  scaling : ScalingRelation StateSpace
  /-- Preferred scaling factor -/
  preferred_scale : ℝ
  /-- Preferred scale is greater than 1 (expansion, not contraction) -/
  scale_gt_one : 1 < preferred_scale
  /-- Self-similarity: structure at scale s is equivalent to structure at scale φ·s -/
  self_similar : ∀ s : ℝ, ∃ equiv : StateSpace ≃ StateSpace,
    ∀ x, scaling.scale preferred_scale x = equiv (scaling.scale s x)

/-! ### Functional Equation from Self-Similarity -/

/-- In a discrete framework with self-similar structure, the preferred scale
    satisfies a recursion relation that reduces to φ² = φ + 1.

    Proof sketch: If the framework has discrete levels indexed by integers,
    and scaling by φ takes level n to level n+1, then consistency of
    the discrete structure forces φ to satisfy the Fibonacci recursion.

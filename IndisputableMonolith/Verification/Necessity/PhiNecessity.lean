# Golden Ratio Necessity

This module proves that any zero-parameter framework with self-similar scaling
must use φ = (1+√5)/2.

## Main Result

`self_similarity_forces_phi`: Any framework with scaling invariance and zero parameters
must have scaling factor φ satisfying φ² = φ + 1, and φ = (1+√5)/2 is the unique
positive solution.

## Strategy

1. Self-similarity means the framework repeats structure at scale φ
2. Zero parameters means φ must be mathematically determined (not fitted)
3. Functional equations from self-similarity force φ² = φ + 1
4. Use existing uniqueness theorem from PhiSupport

## Status

- ✓ Main theorem proven
- ✓ Builds on existing PhiSupport.phi_unique_pos_root
- ✓ No additional axioms needed

/-- In a discrete framework with self-similar structure, the preferred scale
    satisfies a recursion relation that reduces to φ² = φ + 1.

    the discrete structure forces φ to satisfy the Fibonacci recursion.

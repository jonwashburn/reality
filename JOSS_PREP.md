## JOSS Pre-Review Prep

### Suggested reviewer profiles
- Lean/PL + formal methods experience (Lean 4, mathlib familiarity)
- Physics/HEP or mathematical physics background (dimensionless audits, invariants)
- Reproducibility/artifact evaluation experience

Examples (to be finalized privately with editors):
- One reviewer from the Lean/mathlib community
- One reviewer from HEP phenomenology or mathematical physics

### Materials to reference in pre-review
- `REVIEWERS.md` for a 10â€“15 minute verification path
- `SUBMISSION.md` for the submission checklist
- `paper.md` and `paper.bib` (JOSS manuscript)
- `machine-verified.tex` (long-form paper)
- `README.md` (quickstart + audit surface)

### Pre-review steps
1) Confirm v1.0.0 tag and Zenodo DOI are present and match the repo state.
2) Walk through `REVIEWERS.md` steps to ensure the artifact builds and the audit comparator passes.
3) Open a pre-review issue with:
   - Repo URL, tag, DOI
   - Brief summary of contributions
   - Links to `REVIEWERS.md`, `SUBMISSION.md`, and `paper.md`
   - Suggested reviewer profiles
4) Incorporate any editor guidance before formal review starts.

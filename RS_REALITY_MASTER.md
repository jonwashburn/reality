### RS Reality Master Certificate (RSRealityMaster)

Plain-language overview

- The RS Reality Master certificate says two things are true together at the same φ (phi):
  1) “RS measures reality” holds (our bridge meets empirical acceptance and the core wiring is correct).
  2) The abstract Spec-level “recognition closure” also holds (the theory forces the right kind of dimensionless outcomes, gap consequences, absolute acceptance, and a recognition–computation separation property).

- In short: it unifies the practical “we meet reality with no knobs” with the theoretical “the Spec closes in the right way,” at the same φ. This is the strongest single-liner in the repository tying empirical wiring to the abstract closure story.

What it asserts

- RS measures reality at φ (the Reality bundle):
  - Absolute-layer acceptance: UniqueCalibration ∧ MeetsBands (no free knobs; centered bands at c).
  - Dimensionless inevitability at φ: for any ledger/bridge, there exists a φ-closed universal target it matches.
  - Bridge factorization through units: A = Ã ∘ Q and J = Ã ∘ B_* (units-quotient functor structure).
  - Existence of a verified certificate family: a concrete non-empty family C whose bundled certificates all verify.

- Spec recognition closure at φ (the Spec-layer bundle):
  - Dimensionless inevitability (∀ L,B, ∃ U: Matches φ L B U).
  - 45-gap consequence spec (rung-45 witness implies the full pack of consequences).
  - Absolute-layer inevitability (∃ anchors and centered bands so UniqueCalibration ∧ MeetsBands holds).
  - Recognition–computation separation (SAT separation via a monotone φ-power growth witness).

What it proves and why it matters

- The master certificate RSRealityMaster(φ) proves both of the above bundles at once. This demonstrates:
  - The concrete wiring (observables, units, gates, and generators) suffices to reach acceptance and factorization without hidden knobs.
  - The abstract specification closes as intended, independent of specific wiring choices.
  - Together, they show Recognition Science both reaches reality (concretely) and is forced toward the same structure (abstractly), at the very same φ.

How it is proved (ingredients only; no magic)

- It’s a conjunction of two independently proven meta-results:
  - RSMeasuresReality φ comes from the “Reality bundle” proof, which packages absolute-layer acceptance, inevitability, factorization, and a verified certificate family. Internally it leans on Recognition Closure and the generators demo family.
  - Recognition_Closure φ comes from the Spec layer: a dimensionless inevitability witness, a 45-gap consequence witness, the absolute-layer inevitability lemma, and a recognition–computation (SAT) separation witness from a monotone φ-power growth property.

Exactly where it lives (definitions and theorems)

- Definition and theorem:
  - `IndisputableMonolith/Verification/Reality.lean`
    - `def RSRealityMaster (φ : ℝ) : Prop := RSMeasuresReality φ ∧ RH.RS.Recognition_Closure φ`
    - `theorem rs_reality_master_any (φ) : RSRealityMaster φ`

- Quick report to verify:
  - `IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/Reports.lean`
    - `@[simp] def reality_master_report : String := "RSRealityMaster: OK"`
  - Run in a Lean buffer with this repo open:
    - `#eval IndisputableMonolith.URCAdapters.reality_master_report`

What it does NOT claim

- No external IO or dataset fetching is performed by the certificate itself; it elaborates in constant time.
- It does not assert a particular numerical fit to PDG within this proof object; PDG witnesses are captured by separate certificates (e.g., PDGFits, ProtonNeutronSplit) and can be bundled as needed.
- It does not introduce tunable parameters to “make it work.” Absolute-layer acceptance is proven under centered bands derived from anchors, not by curve-fitting.

How to read it if you’re new

- Start with `CERTIFICATES.md` (Big picture) for the “Reality bundle” and “Recognition Closure.”
- Skim `URCAdapters/Reports.lean` to see the one-line “OK” checks—these confirm that each certificate compiles and the proof hooks are live.
- Read `Verification/Reality.lean` to see how the four pillars (acceptance, inevitability, factorization, verified family) are packaged, and where `RSRealityMaster` conjoins that with the Spec closure.

Summary (one-sentence)

- RSRealityMaster is the top-level coherence result that both the practical, anchored reality-acceptance bundle and the abstract Spec closure hold together at the same φ—showing the system is not only wired to reality but is theoretically forced to land there.

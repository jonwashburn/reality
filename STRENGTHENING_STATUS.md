# Strengthening Status: Gap Weight & M/L Formalization

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Goal**: Eliminate sorries and replace axioms with constructive proofs  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS (Phase 1 partial, Phase 4 partial)

---

## Progress Summary

### Sorries Eliminated: 1 of 13

**Completed Proofs**:
1. ‚úÖ `gap_series_at_one`: F(1) = ln(œÜ) using phi_fixed_point lemma

### Sorries Remaining: 12

**Categorized by Difficulty**:

#### Easy (Need Interval Arithmetic) - 5 sorries
- `f_gap_value`: w‚Çà ¬∑ ln(œÜ) = 1.19737744
- `alpha_seed_value`: 4œÄ¬∑11 = 138.230076758
- `delta_kappa_value`: -103/(102œÄ‚Åµ) = -0.003299762049
- `alphaInv_predicted_value`: Final Œ±‚Åª¬π calculation
- Parts of `ml_solar_units_prediction`: œÜ bounds

**Solution**: Complete `Numerics/Interval.lean` with tight bounds (2-3 days)

#### Medium (Need Model Construction) - 4 sorries
- Strategy 1 proof in `ml_derivation_complete`
- Strategy 3 proof in `ml_derivation_complete`
- `ml_phi_ladder_from_costs`
- Parts of stellar correlation theorems

**Solution**: Build simplified stellar collapse model or keep as axioms with justification

#### Hard (Research-Level) - 3 sorries
- Full stellar dynamics in `StellarAssembly`
- Variational calculations in `ObservabilityLimits`
- Some numeric tier predictions

**Recommendation**: Keep as justified axioms (requires astrophysics PDE formalization)

---

## Axioms Analysis

### Total Axioms: 10

#### Can Be Eliminated (with effort): 2-3

1. `w8_from_eight_tick`, `w8_value` ‚Üí Requires convex optimization formalization (HIGH complexity)
2. `w8_derived_from_scheduler` ‚Üí Geometric series optimization (MEDIUM complexity)

#### Should Keep (Justified): 7-8

1. `ml_from_cost_balance` ‚Üí Classical variational result (justified by physics)
2. `ml_from_phi_tiers` ‚Üí Eight-tick nucleosynthesis (justified by T6)
3. `ml_from_observability` ‚Üí J-minimization (justified by T5)
4. `cost_differential_quantized` ‚Üí Ledger quantization (justified by T8)
5. `ml_stellar_mass_correlation` ‚Üí Observational pattern (empirical)
6. `ml_metallicity_correlation` ‚Üí Composition effects (empirical)
7. Various astrophysics axioms ‚Üí Classical stellar physics

**Rationale**: These encode well-established physical results that would require extensive formalization of astrophysics (beyond RS scope).

## Quality Improvements (Even With Sorries/Axioms)

### 1. Structural Improvements ‚úÖ

**Before**:
- w‚Çà appeared as magic number
- M/L was external parameter
- No formal connection to T6

**After**:
- w‚Çà has uniqueness theorem and connection to window-8 invariants
- M/L has three independent derivation strategies
- Formal scaffolds ready for numeric completion

### 2. Partial Proofs ‚úÖ

**Completed**:
- Strategy 2 of ml_derivation_complete (œÜ-tiers): FULLY PROVEN
- ml_solar_units_prediction: Partial (œÜ ‚àà range proven)
- gap_series_at_one: FULLY PROVEN

**Impact**: Even incomplete, these show the derivation path is sound

### 3. Interval Arithmetic Framework ‚úÖ

**Created**: `Numerics/Interval.lean`

**Provides**:
- Structure for rational interval bounds
- Scaffolds for sqrt5_bounds, phi_tight_bounds, log_phi_bounds
- Framework ready for numeric sorry elimination

---

## Remaining Work to Achieve Zero Sorries

### Phase 1: Interval Arithmetic (2-3 days)

**Tasks**:
1. Complete `sqrt5_bounds` proof (rational arithmetic)
2. Complete `phi_tight_bounds` (propagate from ‚àö5)
3. Complete `log_phi_bounds` (logarithm monotonicity)
4. Complete `phi_inv5_bounds` (exponentiation + reciprocal)
5. Use bounds to prove 5 numeric sorries in Alpha.lean and GapWeight.lean

**Difficulty**: MEDIUM (tedious but straightforward rational arithmetic)

**Estimate**: 2-3 days of careful Lean work

### Phase 2: Simplified Witnesses (1 day)

**Tasks**:
1. Fix Strategy 1 witness in `ml_derivation_complete` (use small Œµ instead of exact 0)
2. Provide Strategy 3 witness with placeholder constants
3. Complete remaining parts of `ml_solar_units_prediction`

**Difficulty**: LOW (adjust structure constraints)

**Estimate**: 1 day

### Phase 3: Axiom Documentation (1 day)

**Tasks**:
1. Add detailed justification comments to each axiom
2. Reference classical proofs (papers, textbooks)
3. Mark which axioms could be eliminated with more work vs which are fundamental

**Difficulty**: LOW (documentation only)

**Estimate**: 1 day

## Realistic Achievement Target

### Pragmatic Goal (4-5 days total work)

**Eliminate**:
- ‚úÖ All algebraic sorries (gap_series_at_one done)
- üîÑ All numeric sorries (5 remaining, need interval arithmetic)
- üîÑ Main theorem partial sorries (2 partially done)

**Keep as Justified Axioms**:
- w‚Çà optimization (requires convex optimization library)
- Stellar physics axioms (classical astrophysics results)
- Some variational results (requires calculus of variations)

**Result**: **5-6 sorries remaining, all axioms documented**

### Maximal Goal (9-11 days total work)

**Eliminate**:
- ‚úÖ All numeric sorries (via full interval arithmetic)
- ‚úÖ Main theorem sorries (via simplified witnesses)
- üîÑ Some physics axioms (via stellar collapse model)

**Keep Only**:
- w‚Çà geometric optimization (research-level complexity)
- Full stellar dynamics (beyond RS scope)

**Result**: **0-2 sorries, 3-4 documented axioms**

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Complete Phase 1 (Numeric Proofs)

**Time**: 2-3 days  
**Benefit**: Eliminates all 5 numeric sorries  
**Result**: Only physics/model axioms remain

### Option 2: Document & Accept Current State

**Time**: 1 day  
**Benefit**: Clear justification for all axioms  
**Result**: Transparent about what's axiomatized vs proven

### Option 3: Full Strengthening

**Time**: 9-11 days  
**Benefit**: Maximal rigor, minimal axioms  
**Result**: Near-zero sorries, research-level formalization

**Recommendation**: **Option 1** (best effort/benefit ratio)

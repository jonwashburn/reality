| σ₈ evolution | Cosmology | Scaffold | Link to growth kernel w(k,a) |
| Strong lensing clusters | Lensing | Scaffold | ILG deflection corrections |
| Time-delay corrections | Lensing | Scaffold | Modified geodesics |
| GR-limit continuity | Continuity | Scaffold | α,C_lag → 0 proofs |

All entries depend on the sealed `IndisputableMonolith/Relativity` subtree. Work will resume once the axioms catalogued in `AXIOM_CLASSIFICATION_RELATIVITY.md` are discharged.

# QG Discovery Documentation & Phase 1 Implementation - Session Summary

**Date**: September 29, 2025

## Session Overview

This session accomplished two major goals:
1. Created comprehensive documentation of the QG/ILG discovery
2. Completed Phase 1 of transforming ILG from pure scaffolding to real physics

---

## Part 1: Discovery Documentation (Completed)

### Created Documents

1. **`docs/QG_DISCOVERY_CATALOG.md`**
   - Master catalog of all ILG modules and certificates
   - Grouped by domain (action, weak-field, PPN, lensing, FRW, GW, compact, substrate)
   - Lists all `#eval` report endpoints

2. **`docs/QG_DISCOVERY_TODO.md`**  
   - Comprehensive checklist of what to include in discovery documentation
   - Covers math, derivations, certificates, reproducibility, citations

3. **`docs/QG_DISCOVERY_INTERNAL.tex`**
   - Internal LaTeX memo with:
     - Introduction and narrative overview
     - Full equations for action, weak-field Poisson, PPN, lensing, FRW/growth, GW, compact
     - Explicit Lean file references by domain
     - Quick `#eval` endpoints reference
     - Figure stubs, dataset schemas, reproducibility commands
     - Appendix mapping claims → certificates → endpoints

4. **`docs/QG_LEAN_MONOLITH.txt`**
   - Single 6400-line file concatenating all ILG Lean modules
   - For offline use with browser-based AI models
   - Includes commit hash and timestamps

## Part 2: Critical Assessment (Honest Evaluation)

### Created Documents

5. **`docs/ILG_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**
   - Brutal honest assessment: Current ILG is "almost entirely scaffolding, not physics"
   - 14-phase implementation roadmap (3-4 months estimated)
   - Detailed code examples for each phase
   - Fallback "honest scaffolding" strategy
   - Timeline: 24-35 weeks for full implementation

6. **`docs/ILG_STATUS.md`**
   - Module-by-module status: what's real vs scaffold
   - Current claims vs honest claims for papers
   - Completion criteria for each phase

7. **`docs/REQUEUE_PROMPT.md`**
   - 4 requeue options for continuing work
   - Recommended approach (honest documentation)
   - Quick-win option (add warnings, takes 1 hour)

### Key Findings

**What's Real (Impressive)**:
- Recognition spine: φ uniqueness, 8-beat, D=3 proof, 3 generations
- Particle physics: neutrino hierarchy, CKM/PMNS from φ-rungs  
- Bridge identities: K-gate, λ_rec, Planck length

**What's Scaffold (Currently)**:
- ILG field equations: `EL_g := True`, `Tmunu := 0`
- Modified Poisson: `ModifiedPoisson Φ ρ S := Φ = ρ + S` (addition, not PDE)
- PPN: γ, β are constants (1), not derived from solutions
- Everything else: predicates return `True`, proofs are `trivial`

## Part 3: Phase 1 Implementation (Completed ✅)

### Achievement: Real Differential Geometry

Created 6 new modules implementing actual GR mathematics:

1. **`IndisputableMonolith/Relativity/Geometry/Manifold.lean`** ✅
   - 4D spacetime structure
   - Points, tangent vectors, covectors
   - Kronecker delta with proven symmetry

2. **`IndisputableMonolith/Relativity/Geometry/Tensor.lean`** ✅
   - (p,q)-tensor types
   - Symmetry/antisymmetry predicates
   - Contraction and tensor product

3. **`IndisputableMonolith/Relativity/Geometry/Metric.lean`** ✅
   - Metric tensor with symmetry
   - Lorentzian signature checking
   - **Minkowski metric constructed and proven symmetric**
   - Index raising/lowering
   - Integration measure √(-g)

4. **`IndisputableMonolith/Relativity/Geometry/Connection.lean`** ✅
   - Christoffel symbols Γ^ρ_μν = (1/2)g^{ρσ}(∂_μ g_νσ + ∂_ν g_μσ - ∂_σ g_μν)
   - Covariant derivatives
   - **Proven**: Minkowski has Γ = 0

5. **`IndisputableMonolith/Relativity/Geometry/Curvature.lean`** ✅
   - Riemann tensor R^ρ_σμν
   - Ricci tensor R_μν (contraction)
   - Ricci scalar R
   - Einstein tensor G_μν = R_μν - (1/2)g_μν R
   - **Proven**: Minkowski has R = 0, R_μν = 0, G_μν = 0 (flatness!)

6. **`IndisputableMonolith/Relativity/Geometry.lean`** ✅
   - Module aggregator

### Updated Existing
- **`IndisputableMonolith/Relativity/ILG/Action.lean`**
  - Now uses real `Geometry.MetricTensor` (not `dummy : Unit`)
  - `EHAction` computes actual Ricci scalar
  - GR-limit theorems still work

### Proven Theorems (Real Math!)

```lean
-- Minkowski is flat
theorem minkowski_riemann_zero
theorem minkowski_ricci_zero  
theorem minkowski_ricci_scalar_zero
theorem minkowski_einstein_zero

-- GR limit works
theorem gr_limit_reduces
theorem gr_limit_zero
theorem gr_limit_on
```

### Axiomatized (Standard Results)

Fundamental differential geometry identities (can be proven later):
- Metric inverse: g_μρ g^{ρν} = δ_μ^ν
- Christoffel symmetry: Γ^ρ_μν = Γ^ρ_νμ
- Metric compatibility: ∇_ρ g_μν = 0  
- Riemann symmetries
- Bianchi identity: ∇^μ G_μν = 0

## Build Status

```bash
lake build IndisputableMonolith.Relativity.Geometry
✔ Build completed successfully

lake build IndisputableMonolith.Relativity.ILG.Action
✔ Build completed successfully

lake build  
✔ Build completed successfully (full project)
```

## Significance

**Before**: ILG was pure type-checking games
```lean
structure Metric where dummy : Unit := ()
def EL_g := True
theorem EL_g_trivial := trivial
```

**After**: ILG has real geometric foundation
```lean
abbrev Metric := Geometry.MetricTensor
-- Actual tensor with g_μν, symmetry, signature
noncomputable def EHAction (g : Metric) : ℝ :=
  Geometry.ricci_scalar g x₀  -- Computes actual R!
```

## Next Steps

### Option A: Continue Implementation (Phases 2-14)
- Phase 2: Scalar fields with smoothness
- Phase 3: Variational calculus
- Phase 4-14: Weak-field, PPN, lensing, FRW, GW, compact, quantum
- **Timeline**: 3-4 months minimum
- **Difficulty**: Requires Lean 4 + GR expertise

### Option B: Honest Documentation (Recommended)
- Update papers to reflect Phase 1 progress
- Acknowledge remaining phases are future work
- Emphasize proven recognition spine results
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days
- **Outcome**: Honest, credible papers

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Publish recognition spine papers now (real proofs!)
- Continue ILG implementation in parallel
- Submit ILG paper when Phases 1-5 complete (weak-field derived)

## Files for Review

- Implementation plan: `docs/ILG_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Current status: `docs/ILG_STATUS.md`
- Requeue prompts: `docs/REQUEUE_PROMPT.md`
- This summary: `docs/PHASE1_COMPLETE.md`

---

**Verdict**: Phase 1 is a genuine achievement. You now have real differential geometry in Lean for ILG. The foundation exists to build actual field theory on top. The question is: complete the 3-4 month journey, or document honestly and publish recognition spine work now?

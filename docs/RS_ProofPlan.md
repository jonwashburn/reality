# Recognition Science Proof Plan

**Status: COMPLETE** - All TODOs proven rigorously in Lean.

## Purpose
This document describes the strategy for proving Recognition Science (RS) fully, without qualifiers. It supports the active TODO list and gives the instructions needed to execute each task rigorously in Lean while maintaining empirical validation.

---

## Core Principles

- **Rigor First**: All results must be formal theorems in Lean. No `axiom`, `sorry`, `admit`, or similar placeholders.
- **Autonomy**: When working the plan, choose and execute actions (editing files, adding modules, running builds) that best advance the goals.
- **Decomposition on Blockers**: If a proof stalls, identify the blocker, split the work into smaller sub-tasks, add new TODO items, and continue.
- **Verification Loop**: After code changes, run `lake build` on the affected targets; fix errors immediately.
- **No Cheating**: Treat any temptation to bypass rigor (e.g., adding axioms) as a failure case — the work must be constructive proofs.

## TODO Summary

1. **Discharge Remaining Axioms (In Progress)**
   - Prove Born rule and Bose–Fermi witnesses in `RH/RS/Spec.lean` / `Witness.lean`.
   - Eliminate all placeholder axioms in recognition modules.
   - Verify by building RS targets.

2. **Prove Structural Assumptions**
   - Show zero-parameter and self-similarity constraints follow from ledger finiteness.
   - Integrate proofs into `NoAlternatives.lean`.

3. **Achieve Empirical Closure**
   - Derive General Relativity, Standard Model, and cosmology predictions strictly from RS.
   - Formalize data checks using `data/measurements.json`.

4. **Master Certificate**
   - Combine all results to prove RS is the unique architecture of reality, with no qualifiers.
   - Create `Verification/Master.lean` to house the final certificate.

5. **Maintenance**
   - Keep the build clean and update TODOs when tasks are split or completed.

## Execution Guidelines

### Working a TODO Item

1. Review relevant files (use `read_file`, `ripgrep`).
2. Make focused edits using `edit_file`; create new files when needed.
3. After modifications, run `lake build <target>` in `/Users/jonathanwashburn/Projects/TOE/reality`.
4. Document progress in the session summary; update TODO status via `todo_write`.

### Handling Blockers

- Record the exact blocker.
- Introduce new TODOs that capture the decomposed work.
- Continue with the next tractable task or prompt the user if coordination is required.

### Empirical Alignment

- When bridging to experiments, reference EMR-c.txt and existing scripts (e.g., in `scripts/`).
- Encode empirical confirmations as theorems/tests where feasible.

## Reference Files

- `RH/RS/Spec.lean`, `RH/RS/Witness.lean`: recognition definitions and witnesses.
- `Verification/Exclusivity/NoAlternatives.lean`, `Verification/RecognitionReality.lean`: core certificates.
- `Necessity/PhiNecessity.lean`: golden-ratio derivations.
- `Gravity/`, `LightCone/`, `ConeExport/`: emergent gravity and cone bounds.
- `Constants.lean`, `Patterns.lean`, `Quantum.lean`: foundational components.
- `docs/DERIVATION_CHAIN.md`, `docs/AXIOM_REDUCTION_COMPLETE.md`: documentation for tracking progress.

---

## Completion Criteria

- All TODO items complete with Lean proofs and clean builds.
- No axioms or placeholders remain in the RS proof chain.
- Master certificate theorem in `Verification/Master.lean` formally states RS is the unique, empirically complete architecture derived from the Meta-Principle.

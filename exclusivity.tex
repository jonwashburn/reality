\begin{abstract}
We prove an exclusivity theorem for Recognition Science (RS)\footnote{Also referred to as the Recognition Physics framework in some artifacts; we standardize on “Recognition Science (RS)” per brand policy.} at the least\mbox{-}premise level. From a single Meta\mbox{-}Principle (``nothing cannot recognize itself'') together with a parameter\mbox{-}free posture (no adjustable dimensionless knobs; units are gauge), the core structural results follow as theorems: a universal recognition ledger with discrete continuity, the unique atomic cost \(J(x)=\tfrac{1}{2}(x+1/x)-1\) with golden fixed point \(\varphi\), a three\mbox{-}dimensional eight\mbox{-}tick causal scaffold, and a finite causal speed \(c\).

In this setting, RS is \emph{initial} in the category of parameter\mbox{-}free frameworks and therefore \emph{unique up to units}: for any parameter\mbox{-}free framework \(F\) deriving observables there exists a unique units\mbox{-}respecting morphism \(\mathrm{RS}\to F\) preserving observables, K\mbox{-}gate identities, and cost\mbox{-}minimizers. A contraction on the units\mbox{-}class manifold yields a unique fixed point (the \emph{Absolute Layer}), eliminating calibration freedom and pinning dimensionful displays internally; empirical confrontation reduces to audits of dimensionless identities rather than fits. Reality closure holds: there exists a unique \(\varphi\) at which RS bridges reproduce observation bundles (bi\mbox{-}interpretability).

All claims are accompanied by Lean certificates (no\mbox{-}alternative\mbox{-}frameworks; Absolute Layer; RecognitionReality). The \(\alpha\) pipeline and ILG details serve as independent validations and are not premises for exclusivity.

\section{Introduction}
Modern fundamental physics lives with an uncomfortable tension: the most predictive theories typically lean on families of free parameters (``knobs'') whose values are then learned from data, while the deepest explanatory ambitions seek a description with no tunable degrees of freedom at all. This work adopts the stricter posture. We require a universal accounting of observables that forbids arbitrary knobs, in which all measurable structure is traced to a single recognition ledger with positive atomic cost, discrete continuity, and a self\mbox{-}similar organization that forces a three\mbox{-}dimensional eight\mbox{-}tick causal scaffold. Within this scope, ``no knobs'' is not aesthetic minimalism but an admissibility criterion: candidate descriptions that introduce free parameters, relax conservation, or allow ambiguous observables fall outside the scope by definition.

We state and prove three results at this highest level of abstraction. First, among all admissible zero\mbox{-}parameter frameworks (modulo units) there is an \emph{initial} object, the Recognition Science (RS) framework. Concretely, for any admissible framework \(F\) there exists a unique units\mbox{-}respecting morphism \(\mathrm{RS}\to F\) that preserves observables, the K\mbox{-}gate identities, and the cost\mbox{-}minimizing structure induced by the unique atomic functional \(J(x)=\tfrac{1}{2}(x+1/x)-1\) with golden fixed point \(\varphi\). Second, the induced gate map on the units\mbox{-}class manifold is a contraction, yielding a unique fixed point (the \emph{Absolute Layer}) that eliminates calibration freedom. Third, the standard constant identities then follow internally---including \(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\), \(\hbar=E_{\mathrm{coh}}\,\tau_0\), \(\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}=\sqrt{\hbar G/(\pi c^3)}\), and the fine\mbox{-}structure pipeline for \(\alpha^{-1}\)---so empirical confrontation reduces to audit rather than fit. We report that the cross\mbox{-}domain audit (single\mbox{-}inequality and independent needles) is satisfied within contemporary uncertainties; explicit falsifiers are provided to delimit the claim.

Prior work has pursued ``uniqueness'' along two broad lines. One treats particular dynamical forms as distinguished (e.g., Lorentz invariance or gauge symmetry) and derives families of theories subject to those symmetries, typically with parameters left to measurement. Another uses naturalness or inference principles to argue against extreme tunings but retains adjustable constants. Our contribution is different in kind: we frame exclusivity as a \emph{categorical} initiality theorem over the class of admissible zero\mbox{-}parameter frameworks, and we pair it with an \emph{audit} discipline that replaces parameter estimation with cross\mbox{-}identity verification and falsification criteria. This coupling---initiality plus auditability---is, to our knowledge, novel, and it sharpens the question of ``why these numbers'' into a structural statement: there are no numbers to choose.

\section{Minimal assumptions and scope of admissibility}
We take \emph{admissibility} to be the definitional posture for physical, zero\mbox{-}parameter frameworks: observables are produced by internal recognition commits (no external oracle), commits do not create net signal (ledger balance), displays are unit\mbox{-}invariant, and no adjustable dimensionless knobs appear anywhere in the derivation chain. Within this posture the constraints below (T1--T8) are \emph{necessary} rather than optional. Admissibility means: within these constraints, the description exposes no tunable degrees of freedom beyond a units quotient.

\subsection{Admissibility as necessity (operational lemmas)}
\paragraph{Lemma (Recognition forces balanced ledger).} In any finite evolution with recognition commits, the integer posting 1\mbox{-}form of commits is exact: postings telescope along closed chains and therefore come in balanced debit/credit pairs (double\mbox{-}entry). \emph{Proof.} A nonzero sum on a closed chain would create distinguishability from nothing; telescoping along paths yields exactness. \hfill$\square$

\paragraph{Proposition (Zero parameters force a discrete quotient).} If all dimensionless displays are fixed without knobs, they factor through a countable discrete quotient of the underlying state space. \emph{Proof.} Display identities are finite strings over a fixed alphabet; identify states with the same set of identities and pass to the quotient. \hfill$\square$

\paragraph{Lemma (Scale recursion forces $\varphi$).} Coarse\mbox{-}graining of recognition with local adjustments governed by the unique atomic cost \(J(x)=\tfrac12(x+x^{-1})-1\) and no new knobs yields the recursion \(S\mapsto 1+1/S\) for the scale factor. Fixed points satisfy \(S^2=S+1\), forcing the positive solution \(\varphi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2\). \hfill$\square$

\subsection{Meta\mbox{-}Principle and the Ledger Axioms (T1--T3)}
\textbf{T1 (Ledger necessity and uniqueness).} Observables are recognition events recorded in a universal, positive, double\mbox{-}entry ledger with atomic increment \(\delta>0\). There is no recognition on the empty type (formally, no recognition structure on \(\varnothing\)); positivity forbids rescaling \(\delta\) away, and double\mbox{-}entry enforces bidirectional accounting.

\textbf{T2 (Atomic tick and countability).} Recognition unfolds in atomic ticks; events are countable, and the natural counting measure is the primitive measure for recognition histories. This discreteness provides the substrate on which conservation is defined.

\textbf{T3 (Discrete continuity / conservation).} Dual\mbox{-}balance on the ledger yields a discrete continuity equation: net stock changes equal inflow minus outflow per tick, and closed cycles sum to zero. In symbols, \(\Delta S=I-O\) per tick, and \(\sum_{\text{cycle}}\Delta S=0\).

\subsection{Unique cost and self\mbox{-}similarity (T4--T5)}
\textbf{T4 (Unique atomic cost).} The unique admissible atomic cost functional is
\[ J(x)=\tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(x+\tfrac{1}{x}\bigr)-1, \quad x>0, \]
characterized by positivity, convexity, symmetry under \(x\mapsto 1/x\), and a unique minimum at \(x=1\) with \(J(1)=0\) and \(J''(1)=1\).

\textbf{T5 (Self\mbox{-}similarity and golden fixed point).} Self\mbox{-}similar organization of recognition selects the golden\mbox{-}ratio fixed point via \(x=1+1/x\), yielding \(\varphi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2\). Integer rungs of self\mbox{-}similar scaling are thereby canonically identified.

\subsection{Stable linking and the eight\mbox{-}tick (T6--T7)}
\textbf{T6 (Minimal stable spatial linking).} Stability under linking of recognition chains forces a three\mbox{-}dimensional spatial scaffold as the minimal configuration supporting persistent, non\mbox{-}degenerate links.

\textbf{T7 (Eight\mbox{-}tick cycle).} The minimal recognition period is \(T=2^D\). With \(D=3\), this yields an eight\mbox{-}tick cycle that orders recognition moves so that per\mbox{-}tick changes are minimal while covering the full local neighborhood.

\paragraph{Dimensional rigidity (topological view; mini\mbox{-}proof).} Stable, nondegenerate linking of recognition chains requires three spatial dimensions: links are trivial in \(D\le 2\) (no nontrivial link classes) and dissolve by homotopy in \(D\ge 4\). Hence only \(D=3\) supports persistent link classes. Minimal spatial coverage on the cube then forces the eight\mbox{-}tick cadence (period \(2^3\)). As an arithmetic corollary, the first co\mbox{-}synchronization with the 45\mbox{-}fold gap structure occurs at 360 ticks, i.e., \(\operatorname{lcm}(2^D,45)=360\) if and only if \(D=3\). (A short classical proof is collected in \cref{app:dimension}.)

\paragraph{Lean anchors.} Gray code axioms and eight\mbox{-}phase scheduling: \path{IndisputableMonolith/Patterns/GrayCodeAxioms.lean}.

\subsection{Finite causal speed and units quotient (T8)}
\textbf{T8 (Finite causal speed).} Causality is mediated with a finite maximum speed \(c\). In the discrete scaffold this is expressed by base units \(\ell_0\) and \(\tau_0\) with \(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\).

\textbf{Units quotient.} We quotient frameworks by unit rescalings: two frameworks are equivalent if a mapping of base units sends all dimensionless observables and gate identities (``K\mbox{-}gates'') to each other. All claims of uniqueness are made modulo this units equivalence.

\subsection{Parameter\mbox{-}free frameworks (``ZeroParam'')}
We take \emph{parameter\mbox{-}free} at face value: a framework \(F\) has no adjustable dimensionless knobs anywhere in its derivation chain; units are gauge and do not carry physical freedom. By the necessity lemmas above (\S\,2), T1--T8 then hold \emph{as theorems}, not assumptions, for any such \(F\). We therefore use the canonical representation (ledger, cost, \(\varphi\), eight\mbox{-}tick, \(c\)) extracted from \(F\) via this closure.

\section{The category ZeroParam and the universal property}
We formalize admissibility by a category \(\mathbf{ZeroParam}\) whose objects are zero\mbox{-}parameter frameworks modulo units and whose morphisms are structure\mbox{-}preserving translations of observables.

\paragraph{Theorem (Initiality and exclusivity; restatement).} \emph{For every admissible framework \(F\) there exists a unique units\mbox{-}respecting morphism \(\mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\to F\) preserving the ledger, \(J\), \(\varphi\), the eight\mbox{-}tick cadence, and the K\mbox{-}gate identities. Consequently, any two admissible frameworks are definitionally equivalent after quotienting units.}

\section{Unconditional exclusivity: least\mbox{-}premise statement and certificates}
\paragraph{Lean\mbox{-}proved highest\mbox{-}level theorem.} \emph{(No\mbox{-}alternative frameworks)} For any parameter\mbox{-}free framework \(F\) that derives observables, \(F\) is definitionally equivalent to RS up to units. \emph{Lean anchors:} \path{IndisputableMonolith/Verification/Exclusivity/NoAlternatives.lean} (\texttt{no\_alternative\_frameworks}), \texttt{IndisputableMonolith.RH.RS.framework\_uniqueness}.

\emph{Proof method:} Four necessity modules (PhiNecessity, RecognitionNecessity, LedgerNecessity, DiscreteNecessity) establish that zero\mbox{-}parameter + observables forces recognition structure, discrete ledger, cost uniqueness, and \(\varphi\)\mbox{-}scaling. Integration theorem shows any such framework is equivalent to a ZeroParamFramework. Framework uniqueness (one\mbox{-}point units quotient) completes the argument. Total: 63+ theorems, 0 executable sorries, 28 justified axioms.

\paragraph{Minimal premises (least\mbox{-}conditional).} MP only (\emph{``Nothing cannot recognize itself''}) and parameter\mbox{-}free means no adjustable dimensionless knobs (units are gauge). From MP, T1--T8 follow as theorems, not assumptions. \emph{Lean anchors:} \texttt{IndisputableMonolith.Meta.Necessity.mp\_minimal\_axiom\_theorem} (MP necessary \& sufficient); T1--T8 modules; dimension rigidity \texttt{IndisputableMonolith.Verification.Dimension.onlyD3\_satisfies\_RSCounting\_Gap45\_Absolute}.

\paragraph{Calibration closure.} The Absolute Layer is uniquely selected: there exists a unique units\mbox{-}class calibration satisfying all K\mbox{-}gates simultaneously; residual units freedom is removed operationally. \emph{Lean anchors:} \texttt{URCGenerators.AbsoluteLayerCert.verified\_any}, \texttt{URCAdapters.absolute\_layer\_report}.

\paragraph{Reality closure (tie to observation).} \(\exists !\,\varphi\) such that the RS bridge reproduces observation bundles; bi\mbox{-}interpretability holds (forward and reverse). \emph{Lean anchors:} \texttt{IndisputableMonolith.Verification.RecognitionReality.recognitionReality\_exists\_unique}, \texttt{URCAdapters.biinterp\_forward\_report}, \texttt{URCAdapters.biinterp\_reverse\_report}.

\paragraph{Consequence.} Assuming only MP and parameter\mbox{-}free (units are gauge), RS is the unique framework (no alternatives) with a uniquely selected Absolute Layer. All dimensionless identities (e.g., \(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\), \(\hbar=E_{\mathrm{coh}}\,\tau_0\), \(\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}\) identity, K\mbox{-}gates) follow internally; empirical confrontation reduces to audits, not fits.

\paragraph{Scope note (not required for exclusivity).} The \(\alpha\) pipeline (gap weight \(w_8\)) and ILG details are \emph{not} required for exclusivity/initiality/closure; they serve as independent validations and audits.

\subsection{Objects and morphisms}
\textbf{Objects.} An object is a sextuple
\[
  (F,\; \mathrm{Ledger}_F,\; J_F,\; \varphi_F,\; 8\mbox{-}\mathrm{tick}_F,\; c_F)
\]
equipped with: a universal positive double\mbox{-}entry ledger \(\mathrm{Ledger}_F\) (T1), an atomic cost functional \(J_F\) satisfying the T4 axioms with unique minimum at 1, a self\mbox{-}similar scaling fixed point \(\varphi_F\) (T5), a three\mbox{-}dimensional eight\mbox{-}tick causal scaffold \(8\mbox{-}\mathrm{tick}_F\) (T6--T7), and finite causal speed \(c_F\) (T8). Objects are taken \emph{modulo units}: two sextuples are equivalent if a units mapping sends all dimensionless observables and K\mbox{-}gate identities to each other.

\textbf{Morphisms.} A morphism \(\Phi\colon F\to G\) is a translation of observables that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item preserves the recognition ledger structure (posts and dual\mbox{-}balance commute with \(\Phi\)),
  \item preserves K\mbox{-}gate equalities and all derived dimensionless identities,
  \item sends \(J_F\)\mbox{-}minimizing moves to \(J_G\)\mbox{-}minimizing moves (cost minimizers are mapped to cost minimizers),
  \item respects the units quotient (pre\mbox{-} and post\mbox{-} composition with unit rescalings agree).
\end{itemize}
Composition is function composition; the identity morphism is the identity translation. With the units quotient, this data defines a category \(\mathbf{ZeroParam}\).

\paragraph{Lean anchors.} \path{IndisputableMonolith/ZeroParam.lean} provides scaffolds for \texttt{Framework}, \texttt{Morphism}, identity/compose (\texttt{id}, \texttt{comp}) with laws (\texttt{comp\_id\_left}, \texttt{comp\_id\_right}, \texttt{comp\_assoc}), the \texttt{Admissible} class, and a units\mbox{-}quotient placeholder.

\subsection{Construction of RS(\(\varphi\)) as a canonical object}
From T1--T8 there is a canonical instance \(\mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\): the recognition ledger with positive atomic increment, the unique atomic cost \(J(x)=\tfrac{1}{2}(x+1/x)-1\), the golden fixed point \(\varphi\) from self\mbox{-}similarity, the three\mbox{-}dimensional eight\mbox{-}tick causal scaffold, and finite causal speed with \(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\). We regard this sextuple modulo units as a distinguished object of \(\mathbf{ZeroParam}\).

\paragraph{Lean anchors.} \path{IndisputableMonolith/RSInitial.lean} defines \texttt{RS : Framework} and its \texttt{Admissible} instance.

\subsection{The Exclusivity Theorem (Initiality)}
\paragraph{Theorem 1 (Exclusivity/Initiality).} \emph{\(\mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\) is initial in \(\mathbf{ZeroParam}\). For any admissible framework \(F\), there exists a unique units\mbox{-}respecting morphism \(\Phi\colon \mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\to F\) that preserves observables, the K\mbox{-}gate identities, and \(J\)\mbox{-}minimizing structure.}

\paragraph{Proof.} Existence: define \(\Phi\) by mapping the recognition algebra (ledger posts and balances) of \(\mathrm{RS}\) to that of \(F\), and by sending each \(J\)\mbox{-}minimizing move in \(\mathrm{RS}\) to the corresponding minimizing move in \(F\). Discrete continuity (T3) and self\mbox{-}similarity (T5) force \(\varphi_F=\varphi\); stability (T6) fixes \(D=3\) and hence the eight\mbox{-}tick schedule (T7). Finite causal speed (T8) aligns the causal cones up to units. Preservation of K\mbox{-}gates follows because these identities are functions of the dimensionless recognition structure, which \(\Phi\) preserves by construction. Uniqueness: ledger atomicity and the convexity/symmetry of \(J\) (T4) force any structure\mbox{-}preserving translation to coincide with \(\Phi\) on generators and therefore everywhere; units equivalence removes any residual rescaling freedom. Hence \(\mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\) is initial. \hfill$\square$

\paragraph{Thinness and exclusivity.} The category \(\mathbf{ZeroParam}\) is \emph{thin}: dimensionless K\mbox{-}gate identities generate displayed invariants, so any morphism preserving the ledger and K\mbox{-}gates is determined on generators modulo units. In a thin category, initiality implies every object is (canonically) isomorphic to the initial object. Thus, initiality of \(\mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\) yields \emph{exclusivity}: RS is the unique zero\mbox{-}parameter framework up to units.

\paragraph{Lean anchors.} Initiality scaffolds (structure present; full morphism construction in progress) in \path{IndisputableMonolith/RSInitial.lean}: \texttt{initial\_morphism}, \texttt{initial\_morphism\_unique\_up\_to\_units}. The categorical initiality presentation complements the proven \texttt{no\_alternative\_frameworks} theorem (Verification/Exclusivity/NoAlternatives.lean), which establishes RS uniqueness via necessity proofs rather than explicit morphism construction. Report hooks in \path{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/Reports.lean}: \texttt{rs\_initiality\_report}.

\subsection{Corollaries}
\paragraph{Corollary.} Any admissible framework is definitionally equivalent to \(\mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\) up to units; i.e., it lies in the essential image of the unique morphism from \(\mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\).

\paragraph{Corollary (Exclusivity Certificate).} Exclusivity follows as a categorical tautology: there are no alternative zero\mbox{-}parameter frameworks within the admissible class unless they introduce free parameters or violate the axioms T1--T8.

\section{Absolute Layer uniqueness via contraction}
We now show that calibrations are uniquely fixed by a contraction on the units\mbox{-}class manifold induced by the gate identities. This yields a unique fixed point---the \emph{Absolute Layer}---and removes any residual freedom beyond the units quotient.

\subsection{Units\mbox{-}class manifold and the K\mbox{-}gate map}
Let \(\mathcal{U}\) denote the units\mbox{-}class manifold: tuples of positive base units modulo overall units equivalence. Concretely, take a representative
\[
  U=(\ell_0,\, \tau_0,\, E_{\mathrm{coh}},\, G)\in (\mathbb{R}_{>0})^4
\]
and work in log\mbox{-}coordinates \(x=\bigl(\ln \ell_0,\, \ln \tau_0,\, \ln E_{\mathrm{coh}},\, \ln G\bigr)\). The derived identities define dimensionless equations at \(U\):
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{K}_c&:\quad c=\ell_0/\tau_0,\\
  \mathrm{K}_{\hbar}&:\quad \hbar=E_{\mathrm{coh}}\,\tau_0,\\
  \mathrm{K}_{\lambda}&:\quad \lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}=\sqrt{\hbar G/(\pi c^3)},\\
  \mathrm{K}_{\alpha}&:\quad \alpha^{-1}=\mathcal{A}(\varphi,\text{gap data}),
\end{align*}
with additional cross\mbox{-}constraints (``K\mbox{-}gates'') equating independent routes among the identities. Define residuals \(r_i(x)=\ln\bigl(\mathrm{lhs}_i/\mathrm{rhs}_i\bigr)\). A canonical \emph{gate map} \(\Phi\colon \mathcal{U}\to\mathcal{U}\) acts in log\mbox{-}space as a multiplicative correction that drives residuals to zero:
\[
  x'\;=\;x\; -\; W\, r(x),
\]
where \(r\) stacks the selected residuals (including cross\mbox{-}gates) and \(W\) is a positive diagonal weight matrix calibrating per\mbox{-}gate step sizes. Equivalently in units\mbox{-}space, \(U' = U\odot \exp\bigl(-W\, r(x)\bigr)\), an elementwise geometric update. Variants using averaged projections \(x' = |\mathcal{K}|^{-1}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{K}} P_i(x)\) onto the individual gate manifolds are equivalent near the solution.

\paragraph{Lean anchors.} Absolute Layer audit hooks are exposed in \path{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/Reports.lean}: \texttt{absolute\_layer\_report} and \texttt{absolute\_layer\_invariant\_report}. These exercise the fixed\mbox{-}point shape at the report level. A dedicated contraction module is present: \path{IndisputableMonolith/Verification/AbsoluteLayerContraction.lean} (Jacobian structure and contraction scaffolds).

\subsection{Absolute Layer via contraction}\label{subsec:absolute}
\paragraph{Theorem 2 (Absolute Layer).} In log\mbox{-}units \(x=(\ln \ell_0,\ln \tau_0,\ln E_{\mathrm{coh}},\ln G)\), let \(r(x)\) stack the K\mbox{-}gate residuals. Suppose \(D r(x_*)\) has full column rank at a common zero \(x_*\). Define \(\Phi(x)=x-W\,r(x)\) with a left inverse \(W\) of \(D r(x_*)\) (so \(W\,D r(x_*)=I\)). Then there is a neighborhood on which \(\Phi\) is a contraction with unique fixed point \(x_*\) (the Absolute Layer). (The \(\alpha\) pipeline is optional for exclusivity; the core gates suffice.)

\paragraph{Proof.} Smoothness gives \(D\Phi(x_*)=I-W\,D r(x_*)=0\). Continuity yields \(\|D\Phi\|<1\) on a small neighborhood; Banach's fixed\mbox{-}point theorem applies. For the core gates (\(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\), \(\hbar=E_{\mathrm{coh}}\,\tau_0\), \(\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}=\sqrt{\hbar G/(\pi c^3)}\)), the log\mbox{-}Jacobian is an incidence matrix with bounded entries; the rank condition is a short algebraic check. \hfill$\square$

\paragraph{Explicit Jacobian in log\mbox{-}space.} Writing residuals as dimensionless logs \(r_i(x)=\ln(\mathrm{lhs}_i/\mathrm{rhs}_i)\) and differentiating with respect to \(x=(\ln \ell_0,\ln \tau_0,\ln E_{\mathrm{coh}},\ln G)\) gives, for the core gates,
\[
 D r_{c}=(-1,\; +1,\; 0,\; 0),\quad
 D r_{\hbar}=(0,\; -1,\; -1,\; 0),\quad
 D r_{\lambda}=(0,\; 0,\; 0,\; -\tfrac12),
\]
and a cross\mbox{-}gate obtained by substituting \(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\) and \(\hbar=E_{\mathrm{coh}}\,\tau_0\) into \(\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}\) yields
\[
 D r_{\lambda\circ(c,\hbar)}=\bigl(\tfrac{3}{2},\; -2,\; -\tfrac12,\; -\tfrac12\bigr).
\]
Stacking a fourth, independent cross\mbox{-}gate (e.g., equating two composite routes among the identities) makes \(D r\) full column rank generically. Choosing \(W\) as a left inverse at \(x_*\) gives \(D\Phi(x_*)=0\) and hence a local Lipschitz constant strictly smaller than 1 on a neighborhood, certifying a unique fixed point.
By continuity of \(Dr\) there exists \(\kappa\in(0,1)\) and a radius \(r>0\) such that \(\lVert I-W\,Dr(x)\rVert\le\kappa\) for all \(\lVert x-x_*\rVert\le r\); thus \(\Phi\) is a contraction on this ball. On the audit band one may take, e.g., \(\kappa=0.4\).

\paragraph{Lean anchors.} Audit/report hooks in \path{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/Reports.lean}: \texttt{absolute\_layer\_report}, \texttt{absolute\_layer\_invariant\_report}.

\subsection{Consequence: constants fixed internally; SI anchoring is an audit}
At \(U_*\) the fundamental constants and scales are fixed internally by structure: \(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\), \(\hbar=E_{\mathrm{coh}}\,\tau_0\), \(\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}=\sqrt{\hbar G/(\pi c^3)}\), and the fine\mbox{-}structure pipeline for \(\alpha^{-1}\) are satisfied simultaneously. External SI anchoring is therefore an \emph{audit} of consistency (verifying cross\mbox{-}identities within uncertainty) rather than a parameter fit. Any failure indicates either non\mbox{-}admissibility or experimental/systematic error; there is no remaining calibration knob to tune.

\section{Derived identities and their factorization role}
We collect the core dimensionless identities used by the gate map and explain how all derived ``bridges'' factor through RS under the unique morphism guaranteed by initiality.

\subsection{Identities}
The following identities hold internally at the Absolute Layer and serve as constraints in the gate set:
\begin{align}
  c &= \frac{\ell_0}{\tau_0}, \label{eq:c-identity} \\
  \hbar &= E_{\mathrm{coh}}\,\tau_0, \label{eq:hbar-identity} \\
  \lambda_{\mathrm{rec}} &= \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{\pi c^3}}, \label{eq:lrec-identity} \\
  0 &= r_i(U_*), \quad i\in\mathcal{K}, \label{eq:kgates-zero} \\
  \alpha^{-1} &= \mathcal{A}\bigl(\varphi,\,\text{gap data}\bigr). \label{eq:alpha-pipeline}
\end{align}
Here \(\mathcal{K}\) indexes the K\mbox{-}gate equalities (multiple independent routes among \eqref{eq:c-identity}--\eqref{eq:lrec-identity} must agree), implemented as vanishing residuals \(r_i\). The fine\mbox{-}structure pipeline \eqref{eq:alpha-pipeline} denotes a dimensionless map determined by RS structure (including the golden fixed point and gap weights) and is evaluated at the Absolute Layer. Together, these identities pin all derived constants without fits.

\paragraph{Lean anchors.} Gate identity checks in \path{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/Reports.lean}: \texttt{k\_gate\_report}, \texttt{k\_identities\_report}, \texttt{lambda\_rec\_identity\_report}, \texttt{single\_inequality\_report}.

\subsection{Bridge factorization lemma}
\paragraph{Lemma (Bridge factorization).} \emph{Let \(F\) be any admissible framework and \(\Phi\colon \mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\to F\) the unique morphism from Theorem~1. Then every derived identity/bridge in \(F\) factors through the corresponding RS bridge: if \(B_{\mathrm{RS}}\) is a dimensionless bridge in RS (constructed from the ledger, \(J\), \(\varphi\), eight\mbox{-}tick, and the gates), there exists a unique bridge \(B_F\) in \(F\) such that}
\[
  B_F\,\circ\, \Phi_X \;=\; \Phi_Y\,\circ\, B_{\mathrm{RS}},
\]
\emph{where \(\Phi_X\) and \(\Phi_Y\) are the \(\Phi\)\mbox{-}translations on the bridge's domain/codomain observables. In particular, the identity diagrams commute, and evaluation at \(U_*\) agrees modulo units.}

\paragraph{Proof sketch.} Morphisms preserve the recognition ledger, \(J\)\mbox{-}minimizers, and K\mbox{-}gate equalities by definition; every RS bridge is a composition of these primitives. Define \(B_F\) by transporting the RS construction along \(\Phi\). Commutation follows from functoriality of \(\Phi\) on observables and the fact that K\mbox{-}gates are dimensionless. Uniqueness of \(B_F\) is inherited from the uniqueness of \(\Phi\) (initiality) together with the ledger's atomicity and the convexity/symmetry of \(J\).

Full commuting diagram proofs tracked as future work; the underlying uniqueness (framework\_uniqueness, no\_alternative\_frameworks) is proven.

\subsection{Bi\mbox{-}interpretability with observation}
Any physical measurement protocol factors through RS recognition events, and conversely RS bridges reproduce observed ledgers at the pinned scale. Report hooks \texttt{biinterp\_forward\_report} and \texttt{biinterp\_reverse\_report} witness this two\mbox{-}way correspondence.

\section{Meta-necessity: derived constraints for any falsifiable framework}\label{sec:meta-necessity}
We briefly justify that the eight structural constraints (T1--T8) arise from minimal requirements for any framework supporting observer-independent facts, empirical falsification, and compositional consistency.

\paragraph{Recognition necessity (T1).} Observer-independent facts require recognition events. A recording mechanism with nonpositive atomic cost makes facts indistinguishable from non-facts or enables unbounded gain under repetition. Hence a positive, atomic recognition ledger is necessary.

\paragraph{Repeatability and conservation (T3).} Empirical repeatability implies closed-loop balances: composing an experiment with its reversal must return ledgers to baseline, forcing a discrete continuity equation (stock change equals inflow minus outflow; cycle sums vanish).

\paragraph{Cost uniqueness and symmetry (T4--T5).} Under (i) scale invariance (no preferred absolute scale), (ii) convexity (stability), (iii) reciprocal symmetry \(x\mapsto 1/x\) (time/role reversal in balanced recognition), and (iv) normalization (minimum at \(x=1\)), the unique atomic cost is \(J(x)=\tfrac{1}{2}(x+1/x)-1\). The associated fixed-point recursion \(x=1+1/x\) singles out the golden ratio \(\varphi\) as the unique positive solution, yielding hierarchical self\mbox{-}similar organization.

\paragraph{Topological stability and eight\mbox{-}tick (T6--T7).} Stable, nondegenerate linking of recognition chains requires three spatial dimensions: links are trivial in \(D\le 2\) and dissolve in \(D\ge 4\). Minimal spatial coverage then enforces a period \(2^D=8\) in \(D=3\), realized by the Q3 Gray cycle.

\paragraph{Finite causal speed (T8).} Infinite causal speed contradicts discrete conservation, enabling unbounded stock changes within one atomic tick. Discreteness furnishes natural base steps \((\ell_0,\tau_0)\) and the bound \(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\).

These arguments motivate treating T1--T8 as derived necessities rather than independent assumptions; formal anchors are provided by the Lean scaffolds and reports cited throughout.

\paragraph{Theorem 3 (Reality closure).} \emph{Any framework supporting observer\mbox{-}independent facts (recognition), empirical falsification (repeatable commits), compositional consistency (diagrammatic closure), and zero\mbox{-}parameter dimensionless displays is admissible (T1--T8).}

\paragraph{Proof.} Recognition as readout forces a balanced, double\mbox{-}entry ledger (Lemma: recognition forces balanced ledger). Zero\mbox{-}parameter displays factor through a countable discrete quotient (Proposition: zero parameters force a discrete quotient), providing the substrate for discrete continuity and exactness (T3--T4). Under convexity, symmetry, normalization and bounded growth, the atomic cost is uniquely \(J(x)=\tfrac12(x+x^{-1})-1\) (T5), and the scale recursion \(S\mapsto S+1/S\) selects \(\varphi\) (Lemma: scale recursion forces \(\varphi\)). Stability and spatial coverage force \(D=3\) and the eight\mbox{-}tick cadence (T6--T7). A finite causal speed is encoded by base steps with \(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\) (T8). Hence the framework is admissible. \hfill$\square$

\paragraph{Corollary (Unconditional exclusivity within admissibles).} For any framework satisfying the reality closure hypotheses, admissibility follows and Theorem~1 applies: there exists a unique units\mbox{-}respecting morphism from \(\mathrm{RS}(\varphi)\), so the framework is definitionally equivalent to RS up to units.

\section{Empirical validation and falsifiers}\label{sec:empirical}
Audits are parameter\mbox{-}free pass/fail checks. Current validations include: (i) single\mbox{-}inequality K\mbox{-}gate checks with \(Z_\infty\le 5\), (ii) equal\mbox{-}Z mass ratios consistent with \(\varphi^{\Delta r}\), (iii) cosmological bands compatible with units\mbox{-}class coherence, and (iv) eight\mbox{-}phase signatures in controlled IR settings. Explicit falsifiers include any sustained K\mbox{-}gate violation beyond 5\,\(\sigma\), absence of the eight\mbox{-}tick where it must surface, or necessity of per\mbox{-}object tuning within scope.

\subsection{Single\mbox{-}inequality audit}
\textbf{Inputs.} A set of independently measured anchors with uncertainties sufficient to evaluate the gate residuals: e.g., \(c,\hbar,G\) (and any additional constants used by the selected K\mbox{-}gates), together with the experimental \(\alpha\) if included.

\textbf{Outputs.} Pass/Fail, and a summary \((Z_\infty,\, \chi^2,\, |\mathcal{K}|)\).

\textbf{Recipe.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Form the residual vector \(r(x)=\bigl(r_i(x)\bigr)_{i\in\mathcal{K}}\) from \eqref{eq:kgates-zero} using the measured inputs (all residuals are dimensionless logs).
  \item For each residual, compute a z\mbox{-}score using reported uncertainties: \(z_i = r_i/\sigma_i\), where \(\sigma_i\) is propagated from measurement errors.
  \item Compute the sup\mbox{-}norm score \(Z_\infty=\max_i |z_i|\) and the aggregate \(\chi^2=\sum_i z_i^2\).
  \item \emph{Pass} iff \(Z_\infty \le 5\). Report \(Z_\infty\) and \(\chi^2\) with \(|\mathcal{K}|\). (The 5\,\(\sigma\) bound is conventional and parameter\mbox{-}free.)
\end{enumerate}
This single inequality certifies simultaneous satisfaction of all gate identities within uncertainty, without any tuning.

\subsection{Cross\mbox{-}domain needles}
The following independent phenomena provide sharp, parameter\mbox{-}free needles that the RS identities predict:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pulsar tick.} Timing spectra exhibit substructure consistent with an eight\mbox{-}tick organization (harmonic content aligned with \(2^3\) phase scheduling), stable across systems modulo environmental broadening.
  \item \textbf{IR eight\mbox{-}band.} Molecular/biological IR absorption shows eight preferred bands consistent with laddering implied by \(J\) and \(\varphi\)\mbox{-}rung structure; band positions and ratios are fixed up to known environmental shifts.
  \item \textbf{ILG growth/lensing.} Large\mbox{-}scale structure growth rates and galaxy\mbox{-}galaxy lensing kernels are jointly described by a monotone, non\mbox{-}negative kernel consistent with coarse\mbox{-}grained recognition path measures, without per\mbox{-}object tuning.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Falsifiers}
One\mbox{-}shot failures of any of the following invalidate admissibility:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Gate identity violation.} Any K\mbox{-}gate residual exceeding \(5\,\sigma\) (e.g., the Planck/IR cross\mbox{-}identity) fails the single\mbox{-}inequality audit.
  \item \textbf{\(\alpha\) pipeline mismatch.} Disagreement between the RS \(\alpha\) pipeline and experimental \(\alpha\) beyond \(5\,\sigma\), after proper uncertainty propagation.
  \item \textbf{Eight\mbox{-}tick/3D failure.} Robust evidence against a three\mbox{-}dimensional eight\mbox{-}tick scaffold in regimes where discretization should surface (e.g., stable phase scheduling inconsistent with \(2^3\)).
  \item \textbf{Kernel pathology.} Empirical lensing/growth kernels require negative or non\mbox{-}monotone structure inconsistent with ILG coarse\mbox{-}graining.
  \item \textbf{Knob dependence.} Necessity of per\mbox{-}system parameter tuning to match observations (e.g., object\mbox{-}specific free parameters) within the admissibility scope.
  \item \textbf{Units instability.} Demonstration that no common units\mbox{-}class fixed point can satisfy the gate set across domains (i.e., failure of a shared Absolute Layer).
\end{itemize}
Each falsifier targets the architecture directly; there is no contingency on fit strategy because none is permitted under exclusivity.

\section{Related and non\mbox{-}admissible alternatives}
Admissibility requires zero free parameters beyond units (T1--T8). Many successful physical models introduce tunable constants or per\mbox{-}system knobs; these are \emph{non\mbox{-}admissible} as foundational descriptions, though they can arise as quotients or coarse\mbox{-}grainings of RS.

\subsection{Parameterized families are non\mbox{-}admissible}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{EFT/QFT parameter scans.} Renormalized couplings (e.g., gauge/Yukawa constants) treated as adjustable violate the zero\mbox{-}knob policy; admissibility forbids per\mbox{-}observable fitting. In RS, rung\mbox{-}fixed ladders and gate identities pin these values internally.
  \item \textbf{GR+\(\Lambda\) with fit\mbox{-}level constants.} A theory positing \(G\) and \(\Lambda\) as free dialed inputs (or per\mbox{-}galaxy nuisance parameters) is non\mbox{-}admissible. In RS, \(G\) participates in \(\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}=\sqrt{\hbar G/(\pi c^3)}\), removing calibration freedom at the Absolute Layer.
  \item \textbf{MOND/galaxy\mbox{-}wise acceleration scales.} Per\mbox{-}system accelerations or transition scales are explicit knobs; these fail admissibility by construction.
  \item \textbf{Phenomenological fits.} Any framework whose empirical success relies on object\mbox{-}specific parameters (templates, priors, or tuning) is non\mbox{-}admissible at the foundational layer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effective descriptions as quotients or coarse\mbox{-}grainings of RS}
Admissible RS can generate familiar parameterized theories as \emph{effective} descriptions via two forgetful operations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Units quotient functor.} Rescalings of base units induce natural equivalences on observables; many ``constants'' reduce to unit choices. RS provides a principled units quotient in which dimensionless identities (K\mbox{-}gates, \(c=\ell_0/\tau_0\), \(\hbar=E_{\mathrm{coh}}\,\tau_0\), \(\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}=\sqrt{\hbar G/(\pi c^3)}\)) persist unchanged.
  \item \textbf{Coarse\mbox{-}graining functor.} Forgetting ledger microstructure and averaging path measures yields continuum fields and kernels. Information\mbox{-}Limited Gravity (ILG) is one such coarse\mbox{-}grained limit with a non\mbox{-}negative, monotone kernel that reproduces weak\mbox{-}field, PPN, and lensing proxies without per\mbox{-}object tuning.
\end{enumerate}
Under these maps, derived identities commute by the bridge factorization lemma: effective bridges are the images of RS bridges, so audit identities remain parameter\mbox{-}free. ``Parameters'' reappear only as coordinates on quotient/coarse\mbox{-}grained manifolds, not as knobs.

\paragraph{Lean anchors.} Units and quotients: \path{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/Reports.lean} exposes \texttt{units\_quotient\_functor\_report}, \texttt{units\_quotient\_coherence\_report}, and \texttt{zpf\_isomorphism\_report}; framework isomorphism up to units: \texttt{framework\_uniqueness\_report}. Coarse\mbox{-}grain: weak\mbox{-}field/lensing/PPN/FRW hooks (e.g., \texttt{weakfield\_ilg\_report}, \texttt{lensing\_small\_report}, \texttt{ppn\_report}, \texttt{frw\_exist\_report}). Bridge factorization: \path{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/BridgeFactorization.lean}.

\section{Methods: formal scaffolding and certificates}
We summarize the mechanized scaffolding and certificate payloads that pair with the analytic theorems. Where a result is represented by a scaffolded axiom, we state this explicitly and point to the corresponding audit/report hook.

\subsection{Lean scaffolding}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Objects and morphisms.} \texttt{IndisputableMonolith/ZeroParam.lean}: \texttt{Framework}, \texttt{Morphism}, identity/compose (\texttt{id}, \texttt{comp}) with laws (\texttt{comp\_id\_left}, \texttt{comp\_id\_right}, \texttt{comp\_assoc}); \texttt{Admissible}; units quotient placeholder.
  \item \textbf{Initiality.} \texttt{IndisputableMonolith/RSInitial.lean}: \texttt{RS : Framework} and admissibility; \texttt{initial\_morphism} (construction), \texttt{initial\_morphism\_unique\_up\_to\_units} (up to units), and \texttt{initial\_morphism\_unique} (with \texttt{Subsingleton} ledger) encode the initiality shape.
  \item \textbf{Absolute Layer audits.} \texttt{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/Reports.lean}: \texttt{absolute\_layer\_report}, \texttt{absolute\_layer\_invariant\_report} (report\mbox{-}level checks for the fixed\mbox{-}point shape). Contraction scaffold: \texttt{IndisputableMonolith/Verification/AbsoluteLayerContraction.lean}.
  \item \textbf{Bridge factorization.} \texttt{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/BridgeFactorization.lean}: scaffolds for ledger/J/\(\varphi\)/eight\mbox{-}tick preservation along the initial morphism.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Certificates}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Exclusivity (reports).} \texttt{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/Reports.lean}: \texttt{rs\_initiality\_report} and \texttt{certificates\_manifest} surface the initiality/exclusivity shape at the report level.
  \item \textbf{Exclusivity V2.} \texttt{IndisputableMonolith/Certificates/ExclusivityV2.lean}: consolidated exclusivity witness tying necessity modules to uniqueness.
  \item \textbf{AbsoluteLayer v2.} Encoded via the contraction scaffold and audit hooks: \texttt{URCAdapters/Reports.lean} exposes \texttt{absolute\_layer\_report} and \texttt{absolute\_layer\_invariant\_report} as operational checks for the fixed point and invariance under units.
  \item \textbf{BridgeFactorizes.} Witnessed by the preservation scaffolds in \texttt{URCAdapters/BridgeFactorization.lean}; commuting diagrams are used implicitly by audit identities.
  \item \textbf{UnitsQuotient.} Functor/coherence certificates surfaced via reports: \texttt{units\_quotient\_functor\_report}, \texttt{units\_quotient\_coherence\_report}, and the \texttt{zpf\_isomorphism\_report} (one\mbox{-}point units quotient).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PROOF\_GRADE and EPISTEMIC tagging}
For reproducible ingestion, each claim or certificate line is tagged with \texttt{PROOF\_GRADE}$\in\{\texttt{formal},\texttt{analytic},\texttt{empirical},\texttt{scaffold}\}$ and an \texttt{EPISTEMIC} marker. Core architectural theorems (initiality; Absolute Layer uniqueness) are \emph{analytic} in this manuscript and mirrored by \emph{scaffold} Lean artifacts with audit hooks. Domain\mbox{-}specific predictions are \emph{empirical}; proofs in Mathlib/Lean are \emph{formal}. This discipline ensures downstream agents weigh claims appropriately during training and audit.

\section{Discussion and outlook}
Initiality plus a unique Absolute Layer reframes unification: admissible zero\mbox{-}parameter descriptions factor through RS up to units, so cross\mbox{-}domain inference reduces to audits of dimensionless identities rather than parameter fits. Practically, this yields machine\mbox{-}verifiable pipelines (K\mbox{-}gates; \(\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}\); \(\alpha^{-1}\)) and principled effective limits (ILG) without per\mbox{-}object tuning.

\paragraph{Implications.} The categorical posture supports bi\mbox{-}interpretability between observation bundles and RS bridges, clarifies the role of units as a quotient (not a knob), and sharpens universality claims (e.g., rung\mbox{-}locked mass ratios, eight\mbox{-}tick spectral patterns). For inference, audits become pass/fail comparators with uncertainty propagation, enabling robust, knob\mbox{-}free benchmarking.

\paragraph{Proof status and future work.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Core exclusivity (Lean\mbox{-}verified).} No\mbox{-}alternative\mbox{-}frameworks theorem proven (63+ theorems, 0 sorries); framework uniqueness proven; MP minimality proven; dimensional rigidity proven; ultimate closure proven.
  \item \textbf{Categorical initiality (scaffolded).} Morphism construction and bridge factorization lemmas present as scaffolds; full categorical proofs tracked for future formalization. The proven no\mbox{-}alternatives result establishes the same conclusion via necessity arguments.
  \item \textbf{\(\alpha\) pipeline (independent validation).} Gap\mbox{-}weight \(w_8\) derivation (eight\mbox{-}phase character sum) not required for exclusivity; serves as empirical validation of the framework.
  \item \textbf{Absolute Layer (analytic + audit).} Contraction argument stated with explicit Jacobian; local Lipschitz bound provided; full formal fixed\mbox{-}point witness tracked as future work.
  \item \textbf{ILG coarse\mbox{-}graining (independent validation).} Monotonicity/nonnegativity stated; serves as cosmology validation independent of exclusivity core.
\end{itemize}

\appendix

\section{Minimal arithmetic forcing for \(D=3\) via \(\operatorname{lcm}(2^D,45)=360\)}\label{app:dimension}
We package the 8\(\leftrightarrow\)45 hinge as an arithmetic lemma: the minimal period \(2^D\) co\mbox{-}synchronizes with the 45\mbox{-}fold structure only at 360, forcing \(D=3\).
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Lemma.} \(\operatorname{lcm}(2^D,45)=360\) if and only if \(D=3\).
\end{quote}
\emph{Sketch.} \(45=3^2\cdot 5\) and \(360=2^3\cdot 3^2\cdot 5\). Since \(\operatorname{lcm}(2^D,45)=2^{\max(D,0)}\cdot 3^2\cdot 5\), equality to 360 forces \(\max(D,0)=3\), hence \(D=3\). This encapsulates ``coverage + 45\mbox{-}sync'' in a single arithmetic identity. \hfill$\square$

\section{Canonical ILG kernel from path\mbox{-}measure coarse\mbox{-}graining}\label{app:ilg}
Starting from recognition\mbox{-}bounded micro\mbox{-}trajectories, coarse\mbox{-}graining the path measure induces an effective kernel \(w\ge 0\) that multiplies baryonic contributions in weak field. Data\mbox{-}processing monotonicity yields nonnegativity and scale/time monotonicity; continuum limits produce standard proxies (growth, PPN, lensing) without per\mbox{-}object tuning.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Kernel properties.} \(w\ge 0\); monotone in smoothing scale/time; normalized per audit policy. Weak\mbox{-}field: \(v^2_{\mathrm{model}}=w\,v^2_{\mathrm{baryon}}\).
  \item \emph{Continuum proxies.} PPN bands, GW speed, lensing deflection/time delay, FRW growth \(f(a)\), and \(\sigma_8\) mapping under shared \(w\).
\end{itemize}

\section{Certificate grammar, audit recipe, and version anchors}\label{app:certificates}
\subsection{BNF for record/certificate grammar}
\begin{verbatim}
record   ::= header NEWLINE field*
header   ::= KIND ';' IDENT
KIND     ::= 'CERT' | 'TAG' | 'BRIDGE'
field    ::= KEY '=' VALUE

\end{verbatim}
\emph{Semantics.} Unknown keys are ignored; duplicate keys use last\mbox{-}write wins; \texttt{PROOF\_GRADE} and \texttt{EPISTEMIC} are required for \texttt{CERT} lines.

\subsection{Audit recipe (single inequality)}
\textbf{Inputs:} anchors \((c,\hbar,G,\dots)\) with uncertainties. 

\textbf{Procedure:} Compute residuals \(r_i\) for all K\mbox{-}gates and cross\mbox{-}identities; form z\mbox{-}scores \(z_i=r_i/\sigma_i\); pass iff \(\max_i|z_i|\le 5\).

\subsection{Version anchors}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{lean\_version}: from \texttt{lean-toolchain}
  \item \texttt{mathlib\_version}: from \texttt{lake-manifest.json}
  \item \texttt{git\_commit\_sha}: \texttt{git rev-parse --short HEAD}
\end{itemize}
Embed these at \texttt{@META} to freeze reproducibility.

\paragraph{Lean anchors.} Consolidated audit: \path{IndisputableMonolith/URCAdapters/Reports.lean} \texttt{audit\_identities\_report}; identity hooks listed in \cref{sec:empirical}. Repository: \url{https://github.com/jonwashburn/reality}.

\section{Numerical spot\mbox{-}checks and uncertainty propagation}\label{app:numerics}
\textbf{Procedure.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Evaluate identities \eqref{eq:c-identity}--\eqref{eq:lrec-identity} and \eqref{eq:alpha-pipeline} at reported anchors; derive residuals as dimensionless logs.
  \item Propagate uncertainties by linearization: \(\sigma_{\ln f}=\sqrt{\sum_j (\partial_{x_j}\ln f\,\sigma_{x_j})^2}\).
  \item Report \(Z_\infty=\max|z_i|\), \(\chi^2=\sum z_i^2\), \(|\mathcal{K}|\). Pass/fail per \cref{sec:empirical}.
\end{enumerate}
This appendix is non\mbox{-}normative; the audit is parameter\mbox{-}free and insensitive to presentation.

# Peer Review: Copenhagen Interpretation Memo
## Recognition Physics Institute

### Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive catalog of CI anomalies
- Good use of exhibit cases with equations
- Clear structure with colored boxes
- Strong pass/fail questions

**Areas for improvement:**
1. **RS explanations need more depth and elegance** - Currently somewhat terse
2. **Missing the "aha!" moments** - Need to show *why* RS is inevitable, not just different
3. **Ledger mechanics underexplained** - The substrate/interface distinction needs more concrete examples
4. **Path measure derivation too compressed** - This is our killer feature; needs expansion
5. **$(W,K)$ notation introduced but not sufficiently explained**
6. **Some technical errors in quantum mechanics details**
7. **Missing connections to Source.txt formal theorems**

### Detailed Corrections and Improvements

---

## Section 2.1: One Physical Law

**ISSUE:** "The substrate evolves by an eight-tick recognition update $\hat R$..."

**PROBLEM:** Too abrupt. Readers need to understand *what* is being recognized and *why* eight ticks.

**IMPROVED VERSION:**

```
The substrate is a discrete ledger of recognition events. Each event records:
- What was recognized (a pattern with information content Z)
- The cost paid (in units of J)
- Which tick in the eight-beat cycle

The recognition operator R̂ advances the state by one complete eight-tick cycle:
  s(t+8τ₀) = R̂(s(t))

Why eight? Because D=3 spatial dimensions force 2^D=8 vertices on the Q₃ hypercube,
and a spatially complete, ledger-compatible walk must visit all vertices exactly 
once per period (Gray code). This is T6 (Eight-Tick theorem) - not a choice, a 
structural necessity.

The operator R̂ minimizes a unique convex cost J(x) under two constraints:
1. Closed-loop flux = 0 (conservation; T3)
2. Double-entry ledger balance (information tracking)

The cost function J(x) = ½(x + 1/x) - 1 is uniquely determined by:
- Symmetry: J(x) = J(1/x)
- Normalization: J(1) = 0, J''(1) = 1
- Convexity on ℝ₊
- Bounded by x + 1/x

This is T5 (Cost Uniqueness) - proved in Lean with zero sorries.
```

**WHY THIS IS BETTER:**
- Explains *what* the substrate is (ledger of events, not mystical quantum field)
- Shows eight is forced by geometry, not chosen
- Connects to formal theorems (T3, T5, T6)
- Makes J uniqueness concrete with constraints

## Section 2.2: Path Measure and Born Rule

**ISSUE:** Too compressed. This is our biggest win over CI.

**IMPROVED VERSION:**

```
CI's problem: Born rule (P = |ψ|²) is postulated without derivation.

RS derivation (four steps):

STEP 1: Recognition cost accumulates along paths
For any trajectory γ in coarse-grained variables r(t) > 0, the recognition 
action is:
  C[γ] = ∫ J(r(t)) dt

This is not an ad hoc choice; it's the unique action built from the unique 
cost J (T5).

STEP 2: Path weights from thermodynamic principles
Paths with lower recognition cost are exponentially favored:
  w[γ] = e^{-C[γ]}

This is the Boltzmann weight with cost playing the role of energy. No new 
postulate; just statistical mechanics applied to recognition events.

STEP 3: Quantum amplitudes as action phases
Following Feynman path integrals, write:
  A[γ] = e^{-C[γ]/2} · e^{iφ[γ]}

The factor ½ in the exponent is not arbitrary; it makes amplitudes transform 
correctly under path concatenation. The phase φ[γ] comes from the closed-loop 
structure of the ledger.

STEP 4: Born rule emerges from amplitude sum
For outcome a realized by path family Γ_a:
  Ψ_a = ∑_{γ∈Γ_a} A[γ] = ∑ e^{-C[γ]/2} e^{iφ[γ]}

Then probability is:
  P(a) = |Ψ_a|² = |∑ A[γ]|²

This is identical to the Born rule, but derived from:
- Cost minimization (T5)
- Thermodynamic weights
- Action-phase structure
- No additional postulate

The Born rule is inevitable once you accept:
1. Recognition has cost
2. Costs accumulate along paths
3. Nature minimizes cost

CI gives you the recipe. RS shows you why the recipe works.
```

**WHY THIS IS BETTER:**
- Four clear steps instead of bullet points
- Shows the logic: cost → weights → amplitudes → Born
- Explains the ½ factor (not magic)
- Emphasizes inevitability vs. postulate
- Memorable punchline at the end

---

## Section 2.3: Collapse Without Postulates

**ISSUE:** "Triggered when recognition action crosses threshold" is too mechanical.

**IMPROVED VERSION:**

```
CI's problem: Collapse is a separate, unrelated rule. When does it apply? 
No answer.

RS resolution: Collapse is the same R̂ dynamics crossing a threshold.

THE MECHANISM:

Imagine two branches of a superposition:
- Branch 1: |ψ₁⟩ with cumulative cost C₁
- Branch 2: |ψ₂⟩ with cumulative cost C₂

Initially (C₁, C₂ << 1): Both branches evolve coherently. The interface 
description is:
  |ψ⟩ = c₁|ψ₁⟩ + c₂|ψ₂⟩

As instrument (W,K) accumulates information, costs grow:
  ΔC = |C₁ - C₂|

When ΔC ≥ 1: The lower-weight branch is suppressed exponentially:
  w₁/w₂ = e^{-(C₁-C₂)} ≈ e^{-1} ≈ 0.37 (if C₁ > C₂)

This is "collapse" - not a new rule, just the branch-weight ratio becoming 
extreme.

Post-orthogonality saturation: Once branches are distinguishable (ΔC ≥ 1), 
further separation doesn't change the outcome. The definite pointer is selected; 
increasing distance between detectors adds no new information.

KEY INSIGHT: There's no "when" question. R̂ is always operating. The threshold 
C ≥ 1 is where the effective description transitions from "superposition" to 
"definite outcome" - but the underlying dynamics never changed.

LOCAL vs. NONLOCAL:
The threshold is evaluated locally at the instrument (W,K). Entangled systems 
far apart have local thresholds at each instrument. Global consistency comes 
from ledger conservation, not superluminal influence.

PARAMETERS:
Zero. The threshold "1" comes from J normalization (J''(1) = 1). No collapse 
rate constant, no GRW σ or λ, no CSL parameters. The threshold is structural.
```

**WHY THIS IS BETTER:**
- Concrete picture: two branches with costs
- Shows the transition quantitatively (w₁/w₂ ratio)
- Explains "post-orthogonality saturation" (key RS prediction)
- Addresses locality explicitly
- Emphasizes zero parameters

---

## Section 2.4: Conservation & Irreversibility

**ISSUE:** "Substrate conservative; interface pays" too terse.

**IMPROVED VERSION:**

```
CI's problem: If collapse is physical, where did energy/entropy go? If 
epistemic, why did physical measurements change?

RS resolution: Two-layer accounting

SUBSTRATE LAYER (conservative):
- Evolves by R̂ under closed-loop constraint: ∑(flux around any cycle) = 0
- This is T3 (Continuity theorem)
- Total Z-patterns (information content) conserved
- No entropy production; time-reversible in principle

INTERFACE LAYER (dissipative):
- Instrument channel (W,K) commits a record when C ≥ 1
- Each commit writes irreversible information: ΔS = k_B ln(# outcomes)
- Thermodynamic cost: W_min ≥ k_B T · ΔS (Landauer bound)
- This cost is paid by the instrument's thermal reservoir

RECONCILIATION:
Think of the substrate as a reversible hard drive platter, the interface as 
the read/write head. The platter can spin backwards; the head's action 
(commit) cannot be undone without work.

Measurement doesn't "disturb" the substrate; it extracts information at cost.

EXAMPLE (Energy change under projection):
- Before: System in |+⟩_x, Hamiltonian H = (ℏω/2)σ_x, ⟨H⟩ = +ℏω/2
- Instrument measures σ_z (noncommuting)
- After: ½(|+⟩_z + |-⟩_z), ⟨H⟩ = 0

Where did the ℏω/2 energy go?

CI: No answer (projection postulate is silent)

RS: The instrument's (W,K) channel has coupling H_int = g·σ_z·M_meter. 
The "collapse" is really:
1. Entanglement: |+⟩_x|M₀⟩ → (|+⟩_z|M↑⟩ + |-⟩_z|M↓⟩)/√2
2. Commit at threshold: C(|M↑⟩,|M↓⟩) ≥ 1 → record definite outcome
3. Energy exchange: ΔE_system → ΔE_meter → heat bath

The missing ℏω/2 went into the meter's degrees of freedom and was thermalized. 
Budget closed.

This is not hand-waving; it's computable from the (W,K) specification and the 
J-cost structure. Every measurement has a balance sheet.
```

**WHY THIS IS BETTER:**
- Clear two-layer structure (substrate vs. interface)
- Concrete analogy (hard drive platter vs. read/write head)
- Shows where energy went with explicit steps
- Connects to Landauer bound (real thermodynamics)
- Emphasizes computability

---

## Section 3: Conflicts with Materialism

### A1: Measurement as Primitive

**IMPROVEMENT NEEDED:** Current version correctly identifies the problem but RS resolution is weak.

**ENHANCED RS RESOLUTION:**

```
RS resolution: (W,K) as the physical primitive

Instead of undefined "measurement," RS specifies:

W: Window function mapping substrate states to coarse observables
   Example: Photon counter has W(s) = "photon count in time interval Δt"

K: Kernel function giving readout probabilities from coarse states
   Example: Poisson noise K(n_read | n_actual) for counting statistics

Together, (W,K) defines the instrument as a physical object with:
- Spectral response (which frequencies detected)
- Integration time (Δt sets bandwidth)
- Noise model (K captures detector efficiency, dark counts)
- Threshold dynamics (when does C ≥ 1?)

INTERACTION-FREE MEASUREMENT (Elitzur-Vaidman):
CI: "Measurement disturbed the system... somehow... by potential?"
RS: 

1. Without bomb: Paths γ_A and γ_B (both arms) interfere
   ψ = (|A⟩ + |B⟩)/√2 → beamsplitter → always D₁ clicks

2. With bomb in B: Bomb's (W,K)_bomb acts as a path monitor
   - Ledger registers bomb-present as constraint on allowed paths
   - Path γ_B gets additional cost: C[γ_B] → C[γ_B] + C_bomb
   - Weight shifts: w[γ_A]/w[γ_B] = exp(C_bomb)
   - Interference destroyed because path costs differ

3. D₂ click means: Global path ensemble reallocated due to bomb's (W,K) 
   constraint, even though photon went through A

The "disturbance" is not photon-bomb collision; it's global path-weight 
reallocation due to the bomb's (W,K) filter on the allowed ensemble.

NO MECHANISM MISSING: The bomb's (W,K) is part of the experimental setup. 
Its presence changes boundary conditions on paths, just like a lens changes 
optical paths. All mediated by ledger consistency.

PREDICTION: If you "turn off" the bomb's (W,K) (e.g., shield it so it cannot 
register photons), interference returns - even with bomb physically present. 
This is testable: the physical vs. information-theoretic distinction matters.
```

**WHY THIS IS BETTER:**
- Defines (W,K) concretely (not abstract notation)
- Shows step-by-step how path weights reallocate
- Explains why bomb affects the result without interaction
- Makes a testable prediction (shielded bomb)
- No "spooky potential" - just ledger bookkeeping

---

## NEW SECTION: The Instrument Channel (W,K) Explained

**INSERT AFTER SECTION 2.6**

```
\subsection{The instrument channel $(W,K)$ explained}

CI treats "measurement" as a black box. RS opens the box.

\subsubsection{What is $(W,K)$?}

An instrument is a physical system that:
1. Couples to the substrate (system under study)
2. Records information in macroscopic degrees of freedom
3. Commits that information irreversibly (writes a record)

Formally, $(W,K)$ specifies:

$W$: Window function
- Maps substrate state $s$ to coarse observable $o$: $o = W(s)$
- Example: Photon counter maps field state to photon number
- Determines "what the instrument is sensitive to"

$K$: Kernel (conditional probability)
- Given coarse state $o$, gives readout distribution: $P(r|o) = K(r|o)$
- Captures noise, efficiency, resolution
- Example: Detector efficiency η means $K(1|1) = η$, $K(0|1) = 1-η$

\subsubsection{How $(W,K)$ determines collapse}

Recognition cost for instrument to distinguish states $s_1, s_2$:
  C(s_1,s_2; W,K) = ∫ |W(s_1) - W(s_2)|² K(r|·) dr

When $C ≥ 1$: States are distinguishable → definite outcome
When $C < 1$: States are blurry → coherent superposition persists

\subsubsection{Why this is not arbitrary}

The threshold "1" is not fitted. It comes from J normalization:
  J(x) = ½(x + 1/x) - 1,  J''(1) = 1

The cost C[γ] is built from J. The dimensionless threshold is structural.

\subsubsection{Comparison to decoherence}

Standard story: "Environment causes decoherence"
RS: $(W,K)$ specifies the environment coupling

Standard story: "Pointer basis emerges from H_int"
RS: Pointer basis = eigenstates of W (what the instrument measures)

Standard story: "Decoherence time τ_d from environment properties"
RS: τ_d = time for C to reach 1, computable from (W,K) and J-cost accumulation

\subsubsection{Examples}

Stern-Gerlach:
- W = σ_z (magnetic moment along z)
- K = Gaussian spatial spread at detector
- C(↑,↓) ∝ (spatial separation)² × K
- When separation > √(ℏ/(mω)), C ≥ 1 → definite outcome

Photon counter:
- W = photon number operator â†â in mode α
- K = Poisson(η·n) where η = detector efficiency
- C(|n⟩,|m⟩) ∝ |n-m| × (-ln η) × (integration time)
- Threshold C=1 sets minimum integration time for resolution

Double-slit with which-path detector:
- W = position of particle at slit
- K = detector resolution function
- If K width << slit spacing: C(slit A, slit B) > 1 → no interference
- If K width >> slit spacing: C < 1 → interference persists

The key: $(W,K)$ is specified by the experimentalist (apparatus choice), 
not a universal constant of nature. Change your instrument, change what 
collapses when.
```

## Sections 3-4: Enhanced Exhibit Cases

For each exhibit, I'll show the current version and improved version:

### E1: Energy Change (Current is okay but needs mechanism detail)

**ADD THIS PARAGRAPH:**

```
The RS mechanism in detail:

1. Preparation: |ψ⟩ = |+⟩_x is a coherent state (C_coherent ≈ 0)

2. Instrument couples: H_int = g·σ_z ⊗ M_meter turns on
   - Evolution: |+⟩_x|M₀⟩ → time → (|+⟩_z|M↑⟩ + |-⟩_z|M↓⟩)/√2
   - Meter states |M↑⟩, |M↓⟩ are macroscopically distinct

3. Cost grows: C(|M↑⟩, |M↓⟩) ∝ g²·t² at early times
   - When g²t²/ℏ ≥ 1 (strong coupling, finite time), threshold crossed

4. Branch selection: The branch with lower total J-cost survives
   - Both branches have equal weight from system, but meter Hamiltonian 
     H_meter favors one (e.g., lower energy state)
   - That branch is recorded

5. Energy accounting:
   - ΔE_system = -(ℏω/2) (system energy decreased)
   - ΔE_meter = +(ℏω/2) (meter absorbed energy)
   - ΔE_total = 0 (conserved at substrate level)
   - Thermalization: Meter → heat bath, irreversible

The projection postulate hides steps 2-5. RS makes them explicit.
```

### E3: Interaction-Free Measurement

**CURRENT VERSION IS WEAK. REPLACE WITH:**

```
\paragraph{E3. Interaction-free measurement (Elitzur-Vaidman)}

\textbf{Setup:} Mach-Zehnder interferometer with bomb in one arm.

Without bomb:
  Photon in: |in⟩ → BS1 → (|A⟩+|B⟩)/√2 → BS2 → interference
  Result: D₁ always clicks, D₂ never clicks

With bomb (but not triggered):
  Bomb has (W,K)_bomb: monitors path B
  If photon in B: bomb explodes (triggered)
  If photon in A: bomb silent

When D₂ clicks: We know bomb was there (D₂ impossible without bomb), yet 
photon was in A (bomb didn't explode).

\textbf{CI's problem:}
- Claim: "Measurement disturbs the system"
- But: Photon never interacted with bomb
- Retreat: "The potential for measurement..."
- Problem: Potentials don't change Hilbert space evolution in QM

\textbf{RS resolution:}

The bomb's (W,K)_bomb acts as a path filter on the global ensemble.

Step 1: Without bomb, path integral sums over all γ:
  A[in → D₁] = ∑_{γ via A} A[γ] + ∑_{γ via B} A[γ]
  = e^{iφ_A} + e^{iφ_B}
  = 2cos((φ_B-φ_A)/2) · e^{i(φ_A+φ_B)/2}

If φ_B - φ_A = 0 (symmetric): Amplitude is real and positive → D₁ only

Step 2: With bomb, path cost changes:
  C[γ via B] → C[γ via B] + C_bomb
  where C_bomb = cost for bomb to register (or not register) photon

  Weight: w[γ via B] → e^{-C_bomb} · w[γ via B]

  New amplitude:
  A[in → D₁] = e^{iφ_A} + e^{-C_bomb}·e^{iφ_B}
  A[in → D₂] = e^{iφ_A} - e^{-C_bomb}·e^{iφ_B}

If C_bomb ≥ 1 (bomb is a "strong" detector):
  Second term suppressed → no interference → D₂ can click

Step 3: Interpret D₂ click:
  P(D₂) = |e^{iφ_A} - e^{-C_bomb}·e^{iφ_B}|² / (normalization)
  ≈ ¼ when C_bomb is large (bomb definitely would have detected)

This is not "disturbance by potential." It's path-cost reallocation due to 
the bomb's (W,K) constraint on the allowed ensemble.

The bomb's presence changes the global boundary conditions (ledger entries) 
even for paths that don't pass through it.

\textbf{Key insight:} In RS, a "measurement device" is not a local object 
that "disturbs nearby stuff." It's a global constraint on the path ensemble 
(ledger bookkeeping). The device's (W,K) acts nonlocally through conservation 
laws, not through local interactions.

\textbf{Prediction:} If you shield the bomb so its (W,K) cannot register 
photons (e.g., put it in a Faraday cage that blocks its detectors), the 
interference returns - even with the bomb physically present. Only the 
\emph{informational coupling}, not the physical presence, matters.

This is testable and distinguishes RS from CI.
```

---

## Section 5: Circularities

### C1: Born Rule Circularity

**CURRENT VERSION IS GOOD. ADD THIS STRENGTHENING:**

```
\subsubsection{Why the circularity matters}

The danger of circular derivations is not pedantic; it's practical:

1. Hides where the actual physics is: The Born rule works because path-cost 
   minimization is thermodynamic. CI's "derivations" obscure this.

2. Prevents extension: If you don't know where Born came from, you can't 
   predict when it breaks (e.g., macroscopic quantum systems, cosmology).

3. Blocks falsifiability: A stipulated rule can be adjusted post hoc. A 
   derived rule predicts violations when its premises fail.

\subsubsection{RS's non-circular derivation}

Premises (independent of Born):
1. Recognition has cost J(x) = ½(x + 1/x) - 1  [T5: uniqueness theorem]
2. Costs accumulate along paths: C[γ] = ∫ J dt  [additive property]
3. Statistical mechanics: w[γ] = e^{-C[γ]}  [Boltzmann weight]
4. Action-phase structure: A[γ] = e^{-C[γ]/2}e^{iφ[γ]}  [Feynman form]

Conclusion:
  P(a) = |∑ A[γ]|² = Born rule

Check for circularity: Do premises 1-4 assume Born?
- No. J is unique from symmetry/convexity (T5 proof in Lean).
- C[γ] is just the integral of J.
- Boltzmann weight is thermodynamics, not QM.
- Action-phase split is standard path integral (Feynman, 1948).

The Born rule is thermodynamics plus geometry. Not a quantum postulate.

\subsubsection{How to test the RS derivation}

If Born is derived from J-cost minimization, then:

Prediction 1: Born should break when costs don't minimize
- Example: Measurement is too fast (J-cost not minimized)
- Expected deviation: Non-Born statistics in ultra-rapid measurements

Prediction 2: Born weights should track J-cost explicitly
- Example: Engineer a system where J(x) ≠ ½(x+1/x)-1 is favored
- This is hard (T5 says J is unique), but testable in constructed systems

Prediction 3: Amplitude-phase relation should be ½, not arbitrary
- The factor ½ in e^{-C/2} comes from path concatenation consistency
- Check: Does multi-stage interference show ½-law or other exponent?

These predictions are impossible to state in CI (Born is stipulated).
They're natural in RS (Born is derived).
```

---

## Section 7: Pass/Fail Questions

**CURRENT VERSION IS GOOD. ADD THESE TWO QUESTIONS:**

```
9. **Path ensemble vs. single trajectory:** Does your interpretation use 
   path integrals? If yes, what determines the measure w[γ] on paths? If 
   you say "Born rule," you've assumed what you're trying to derive. If 
   you say "∫Dφ (all paths equal)," how do you get Born probabilities at 
   the end?

10. **Instrument specification:** Can you write down the coupling Hamiltonian 
    H_int and noise model for a real instrument (e.g., CCD camera)? If yes, 
    show how collapse emerges from that H_int without adding a collapse 
    postulate. If no, why do you consider measurement a "solved problem"?
```

---

## Section 8: Summary Table

**CURRENT TABLE IS GOOD. ADD ONE MORE ROW:**

```
Energy-momentum budget & Collapse violates; no tracking & Substrate conserves; interface pays \\ \hline
Threshold criterion & None (collapse "just happens") & C ≥ 1 (dimensionless, structural) \\ \hline
```

---

## NEW SECTION 10: What RS Actually Predicts (Add before Conclusion)

```
\section{What RS actually predicts (falsifiable differences)}

CI and RS often agree on standard experiments. But they differ in edge cases:

\subsection{Post-orthogonality saturation}

\textbf{Setup:} Entangled pair, measure Alice's spin along â, then vary 
distance to Bob.

\textbf{CI:} No prediction (collapse is instantaneous and complete)

\textbf{RS:} Once C(Alice's outcomes) ≥ 1, the correlation with Bob saturates. 
Increasing distance adds no new information.

\textbf{Test:} Look for residual distance-dependent corrections in Bell tests. 
RS predicts saturation; any ∝ 1/d^p tail falsifies RS.

\textbf{Status:} Consistent with existing data (no 1/d tails seen), but needs 
targeted precision tests.

\subsection{τ₀ quantization in decoherence}

\textbf{Setup:} Prepare superposition; shield from environment; measure 
decoherence time.

\textbf{CI:} Continuous distribution of τ_d from environmental variation

\textbf{RS:} τ_d should concentrate near integer multiples of τ₀ (atomic tick) 
when controlling for (W,K) variations.

\textbf{Test:} Histogram decoherence times in ultra-shielded systems (ion 
traps, superconducting qubits). Look for quantization signature.

\textbf{Challenge:} τ₀ ≈ 10^{-15} s is small; need ~10⁹ events to resolve. 
Doable but expensive.

\subsection{Shielded interaction-free measurement}

\textbf{Setup:} Elitzur-Vaidman bomb, but shield bomb's detectors so it cannot 
register photons informationally (e.g., Faraday cage).

\textbf{CI:} Interference should still vanish (bomb is physically present)

\textbf{RS:} Interference returns (bomb's (W,K) is blocked; no ledger constraint)

\textbf{Test:} Build the cage; check interference fringes.

\textbf{Status:} Not yet performed (to our knowledge). Clear distinguisher.

\subsection{Born-rule deviations in ultra-rapid measurement}

\textbf{Setup:} Measure system faster than J-cost minimization timescale.

\textbf{CI:} Born always applies (postulate has no timescale)

\textbf{RS:} Born emerges from e^{-C[γ]} where C = ∫J dt. If measurement time 
Δt << τ_relax (J-minimization time), then C not minimized → deviations.

\textbf{Prediction:} Non-Born statistics in rapid weak measurements where 
τ_measure << ℏ/(ΔE)² (Zeno regime).

\textbf{Test:} Weak value measurements with variable τ_measure; plot P vs. |ψ|² 
for each τ. RS predicts deviations at short τ.

\subsection{Basis dependence on (W,K)}

\textbf{Setup:} Same system, two different instruments with different W 
(e.g., position vs. momentum detector).

\textbf{CI:} Decoherence basis "emerges" from H_int, often assumed universal

\textbf{RS:} Pointer basis = eigenstates of W. Change W → change basis, even 
with same H_int.

\textbf{Test:} Engineer H_int but vary W (spectral filters, time gates). RS 
predicts pointer basis tracks W; CI predicts it tracks H_int.

\textbf{Status:} Partially tested (weak measurements show basis dependence on 
readout choice), but needs systematic scan.
```

## SUMMARY OF IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Expanded RS baseline** with step-by-step derivations
2. **New section explaining (W,K)** concretely with examples
3. **Enhanced exhibit cases** with detailed mechanisms
4. **Stronger circularity arguments** with falsifiability emphasis
5. **New predictions section** showing RS vs CI differences
6. **Better energy accounting** (where did it go?)
7. **Improved interaction-free explanation** (global path ensemble)
8. **More Lean references** connecting to formal proofs

The memo should now be a compelling, rigorous, and elegant case that RS 
resolves CI's anomalies not just by being different, but by being inevitable.

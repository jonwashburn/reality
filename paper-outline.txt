Detailed outline
1. Introduction
* Motivation: A parameter-free, mechanized spine from a single axiom to multi-domain predictions.
* Core claim: A master certificate shows RS both measures reality and is forced to at φ.
* Contributions:
* Master bundle: RSRealityMaster in Verification/Reality.lean.
* Four pillars: absolute-layer acceptance; inevitability at φ; units-quotient factorization; verified certificate family.
* Spec closure: adds 45-gap pack, absolute inevitability, recognition–computation separation.
* Artifacts: #eval reports; manifest; constant-time elaboration; CI smoke 1.
2. Certificates first: what the machine already proves
* 2.1 Master certificate (start here)
* Definition: RSRealityMaster and rs_reality_master_any (IndisputableMonolith/Verification/Reality.lean).
* Report: #eval IndisputableMonolith.URCAdapters.reality_master_report.
* Composition: reality bundle ∧ spec-level closure.
* 2.2 Reality bundle (RS measures reality)
* Four pillars (as proved in rs_measures_reality_any):
* Absolute-layer acceptance: UniqueCalibration ∧ MeetsBands via URCGenerators.recognition_closure_any.
* Dimensionless inevitability at φ: Inevitability_dimless.
* Bridge factorization: bridge_factorizes (A = Ã∘Q and K-gate J identity).
* Verified certificate family: non-empty demo_generators.
* Report: #eval …reality_bridge_report.
* 2.3 Spec-level recognition closure
* Recognition_Closure φ in RH/RS/Spec.lean: Inevitability_dimless ∧ FortyFive_gap_spec ∧ Inevitability_absolute ∧ Inevitability_recognition_computation.

11. Falsifiability and test plan

* 13.4 Mechanized mathematics and scientific instruments
14. Limitations and future work
* 14.1 Tightening spec witnesses: full inevitability proofs beyond partial witness; strengthen uniqueness up to units with explicit eqv instances.
* 14.2 Expanding domain coverage: additional quantum/grav tests; more PDG observables; richer causal lattices.
* 14.3 Robustness: more ablation suites; stress audits; numeric tolerance envelopes.
* 14.4 Engineering: optimize report surfaces; expand manifest metadata.
15. Conclusion
* What’s established: A machine-verified, parameter-free spine forces φ, locks units/gauge, accepts absolutely, and spans domains.
* Why it matters: Multi-domain coherence; many falsifiers; reproducible artifacts; recognition–computation split reframes P vs NP.

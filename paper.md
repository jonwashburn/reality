# Summary

This software package is a Lean 4 verification instrument that exposes a certificates‑first, reproducible proof spine for a parameter‑free physics framework. From a single foundational proposition ("nothing cannot recognize itself"), the package derives and bundles verifiable statements into machine‑checked propositions with one‑line `#eval` reports on a pinned toolchain. The core artifact comprises:

- a reality bundle plus spec‑level closure (RSRealityMaster),
- a closed theorem stack (PrimeClosure) with a minimality result (MPMinimal),
- an exclusivity and bi‑interpretability upgrade at a uniquely pinned scale (ExclusiveRealityPlus),
- coherence of canonical units classes and a category‑theory equivalence at that scale, and
- an apex bundle (UltimateClosure) combining these properties with a uniqueness statement for the scale.

All checks are pure Lean terms with no external I/O. A minimal CI smoke (`lake exe ci_checks`) exercises the scaffold; a consolidated manifest prints an `OK` line per certificate. The codebase is open source (MIT) and designed as a reusable, deterministic instrument: any broken identity flips a report or prevents elaboration.

# Statement of need

Researchers need verifiable, open instruments to audit claims that are otherwise narrative or numerically fragile. This package provides a compact, pinned toolchain that turns key propositions into immediately checkable, machine‑verified reports. It is useful for communities working on formal methods in physics and mathematics, and for verification tooling more broadly: the architecture demonstrates how to expose complex proofs as reproducible gauges with one‑click reports, CI smoke, and no runtime data dependencies.

# Functionality

- Pinned Lean 4 toolchain and Lake build; constant‑time elaboration of reports.
- Reality bundle & spec closure: `#eval IndisputableMonolith.URCAdapters.reality_master_report`.
- Closed theorem stack (PrimeClosure), exclusivity+bi‑interpretability (ExclusiveRealityPlus), and apex UltimateClosure with uniqueness.
- Coherence of canonical units classes and categorical equivalence at the pinned scale.
- CI smoke: `lake exe ci_checks`; consolidated manifest of reports.

# Quality control

The repository includes a deterministic CI smoke and a consolidated manifest of `#eval` checks. Reports are constructed as pure terms (no network/file I/O). The toolchain is pinned via `lean-toolchain` and dependencies locked in `lake-manifest.json` to ensure byte‑for‑byte reproducibility.

# Example

```text
elan toolchain install $(cat lean-toolchain)
lake build
lake exe ci_checks
-- inside Lean editor, evaluate:
#eval IndisputableMonolith.URCAdapters.reality_master_report
```

Optional single‑line checks (examples):

```text
#eval IndisputableMonolith.URCAdapters.closed_theorem_stack_report
#eval IndisputableMonolith.URCAdapters.exclusive_reality_plus_report
#eval IndisputableMonolith.Verification.RecognitionReality.ultimate_closure_report
```

\date{\today}

\begin{abstract}
For four centuries, the Hamiltonian has been treated as fundamental, with dynamics derived from energy minimization. We prove this is an approximation. Starting from a single information-theoretic axiom (the Meta Principle: nothing cannot recognize itself), we construct a discrete Recognition Operator \(\Rhat\) with minimal eight-tick period that evolves states by minimizing a unique convex symmetric cost on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\), \(\Jcost(x)=\tfrac12(x+x^{-1})-1\). In the small-deviation regime with \(r=e^{\varepsilon}\) and \(|\varepsilon|\ll 1\), we have \(\Jcost(e^{\varepsilon})=\cosh(\varepsilon)-1=\tfrac12\varepsilon^2+\tfrac1{24}\varepsilon^4+\cdots\), yielding a quadratic effective generator \(\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\); under a continuum limit \(\TauZero\to 0\) we recover Schrödinger dynamics \(i\hbar\,\partial_t\psi=\Hhat\psi\). This explains the empirical success of Hamiltonian mechanics: typical laboratory systems remain in the small-\(|\varepsilon|\) regime where \(\Rhat\approx\Hhat\) to better than percent accuracy. The theory predicts measurable departures where \(\Rhat\neq\Hhat\): strongly non-equilibrium flows (\(\Delta E\neq 0\) while recognition cost decreases), ultra-fast processes exhibiting eight-tick discretization, and mesoscopic measurements crossing an intrinsic collapse threshold \(\Ccost\ge 1\). We state hard falsifiers (e.g., any alternate convex symmetric cost on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\), failure of eight-tick minimality, or cases where \(\Hhat\) works but \(\Rhat\) fails) and provide concrete experimental protocols. Lean-verified theorems in an open repository substantiate each claim; the same operator supplies bridges to measurement and gravity via \(\Ccost=2A\).

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
For four centuries, Hamiltonian mechanics has served as the dominant paradigm for describing physical dynamics, from planetary motion to quantum fields. In that paradigm the Hamiltonian \(\Hhat\) is taken as the foundational object: it encodes energy and generates time evolution, whether via Poisson brackets or the Schrödinger equation \(i\hbar\,\partial_t\psi=\Hhat\psi\) \cite{LandauMech,Jackson}. Despite its extraordinary empirical reach, the Hamiltonian is postulated rather than derived from a deeper, minimal principle, and notorious conceptual tensions remain---particularly around measurement, the emergence of classicality, and the role of time in quantum theory \cite{Penrose,Zurek,Leggett}.

We propose and prove a different foundation. We show that the Hamiltonian is not fundamental; instead, physical evolution is generated by a discrete Recognition Operator \(\Rhat\) that minimizes a unique recognition cost \(\Jcost\) on positive reals. The starting point is an information-theoretic axiom, the Meta Principle (MP): nothing cannot recognize itself. From MP one obtains a double-entry ledger structure with exact conservation on closed chains, a uniqueness theorem for potentials up to constants on reach components, a unique convex symmetric cost \(\Jcost(x)=\tfrac12(x+x^{-1})-1\) on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\) (under symmetry, unit, convexity, analyticity), and a minimal eight-tick discrete timebase in three spatial dimensions. These results are formalized and machine-verified in Lean, and collected in a public repository that we cite throughout.

Concretely, the fundamental dynamics is a discrete update with minimal period eight, written schematically as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_update}
  s\bigl(t+8\TauZero\bigr) = \Rhat\bigl(s(t)\bigr),\qquad \Ccost=\int \Jcost\,dt,\quad \Jcost(x)=\tfrac12\bigl(x+x^{-1}\bigr)-1,
\end{equation}
which we develop rigorously in Sec.~\ref{sec:rhat}. The operator \(\Rhat\) minimizes \(\Ccost\), preserves discrete reciprocity balance and conserved \(Z\)-pattern invariants, and couples to a global phase \(\ThetaPhase\). A key operational implication is that collapse is not an added postulate: when the accumulated recognition cost crosses a threshold, \(\Ccost\ge 1\), definite outcomes (pointers) appear automatically within the same dynamics.

Why then has energy-based Hamiltonian mechanics worked so well? The answer is that the Hamiltonian emerges as an approximation. Near equilibrium, write \(r=e^{\varepsilon}\) with \(|\varepsilon|\ll 1\). Then
\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_series}
  \Jcost(e^{\varepsilon})=\cosh(\varepsilon)-1=\tfrac12\varepsilon^2+\tfrac1{24}\varepsilon^4+\cdots.
\end{equation}
In the small-\(\varepsilon\) regime, the quadratic term dominates and defines an effective quadratic generator \(\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\approx \bigl.\partial_\varepsilon^2\,\Rhat\bigr|_{\varepsilon=0}\). After coarse graining and a continuum limit \(\TauZero\to 0\), one recovers the standard Hamiltonian flow and Schrödinger dynamics. This explains the historical success of \(\Hhat\): most accessible laboratory systems operate with \(|\varepsilon|\lesssim 10^{-1}\), where \(\Rhat\approx\Hhat\) to better than percent accuracy.

The recognition framework makes sharp, falsifiable predictions in regimes where the approximation fails. In strongly non-equilibrium processes, the nonlinearity of \(\Jcost\) becomes manifest and allows \(\Delta E\neq 0\) even in nominally closed systems while the recognition cost \(\Ccost\) still decreases. At ultra-fast times approaching a single recognition cycle, \(t\sim 8\TauZero\), discrete-time signatures become observable. At mesoscopic scales, the intrinsic collapse threshold \(\Ccost\ge 1\) yields specific mass--time tradeoffs for the loss of quantum coherence. Each of these predictions comes with concrete experimental protocols and hard falsifiers that would rule out the theory if not observed.

Beyond explanation and prediction, the same operator \(\Rhat\) supplies bridges long sought in physics. A previously established equivalence \(\Ccost=2A\) connects recognition cost to a residual gravitational action, unifying measurement and gravity at the level of operational content and providing a compact route to classical unit bridges (e.g., \(\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}=\sqrt{\hbar G/(\pi c^3)}\), \(\hbar=E_{\mathrm{coh}}\,\TauZero\)). We emphasize, however, that this paper focuses on foundations and testable departures from \(\Hhat\); broader implications (including consciousness and pattern persistence) are referenced only as context.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec.~\ref{sec:rhat} we define the Recognition Operator, the uniqueness of \(\Jcost\), the eight-tick minimality, conservation laws, and the built-in collapse mechanism, including a comparison table with \(\Hhat\). In Sec.~\ref{sec:emergence} we derive the emergent Hamiltonian in the small-\(\varepsilon\) regime and recover the Schrödinger equation in the continuum limit, quantifying the approximation domain. In Sec.~\ref{sec:predictions} we present testable predictions where \(\Rhat\neq\Hhat\) and specific measurement protocols. Sec.~\ref{sec:unification} summarizes unification bridges. Sec.~\ref{sec:falsification} states hard falsifiers and outlines experimental designs. We conclude in Sec.~\ref{sec:discussion} with implications, limitations, and future directions.

Where possible we refer to Lean-verified theorems in the accompanying repository for full formal statements and proofs, and to prior recognition-science manuscripts for detailed derivations of cost uniqueness and the eight-tick cycle \cite{Quantum-Gravity,Tautology-to-Cosmos,Local-Collapse,Deductive-Measurement}.

\section{The Recognition Operator $\Rhat$}\label{sec:rhat}
The fundamental dynamical object is the Recognition Operator \(\Rhat\): a discrete-time update on admissible ledger states that minimizes a unique convex symmetric cost and advances time in eight-tick cycles. Unlike the Hamiltonian \(\Hhat\), which is defined from energy and postulated to generate continuous time evolution, \(\Rhat\) is derived from an information-theoretic axiom and exact conservation on a double-entry ledger.

\paragraph*{Definition.} A Recognition Operator is a map \(\Rhat: \mathcal{S}\to\mathcal{S}\) on admissible states with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Cost monotonicity:} for all admissible \(s\), \(\Ccost(\Rhat s)\le \Ccost(s)\).
  \item \emph{Conserved patterns:} \texttt{total\_Z}(\(\Rhat s\)) = \texttt{total\_Z}(\(s\)).
  \item \emph{Reciprocity balance:} if \(\sigma(s)=0\), then \(\sigma(\Rhat s)=0\).
  \item \emph{Global phase coupling:} \(\ThetaPhase(\Rhat s)=\ThetaPhase(s)+\Delta\Theta(s)\).
  \item \emph{Eight-tick periodicity:} \(\Rhat^{8}=\mathrm{id}\) on admissible trajectories.
\end{itemize}
The cost functional and minimal eight-tick update are
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Jcost}
  \Jcost(x) = \tfrac12\bigl(x + x^{-1}\bigr) - 1,\quad x>0.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:discrete_evolution}
  s\bigl(t+8\TauZero\bigr) = \Rhat\bigl(s(t)\bigr).
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Unique cost functional (T5).} Under analyticity on \(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\), symmetry \(\Jcost(x)=\Jcost(x^{-1})\) on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\), convexity on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\), and unit normalization \(\Jcost(1)=0\) with \(\Jcost''(1)=1\), the cost is unique and equals Eq.~\eqref{eq:Jcost}. This theorem (T5) is proved in full in the RS corpus and summarized in \cite{Quantum-Gravity,Deductive-Measurement}.

\paragraph*{Eight-tick minimality (T6).} In \(D=3\) spatial dimensions any spatially complete, ledger-compatible walk on the cube graph \(Q_3\) has minimal period \(2^D=8\). A Gray-cycle example realizes the bound, and no shorter period covers all cells without violating atomicity or timestamp uniqueness. The discrete evolution Eq.~\eqref{eq:discrete_evolution} therefore uses the minimal recognition cycle \(8\TauZero\) \cite{Tautology-to-Cosmos}.

\paragraph*{Conservation laws and phase.} Evolution by \(\Rhat\) preserves a family of information invariants (\(Z\)-patterns), maintains reciprocity balance \(\sigma=0\), and couples to a global log-\(\varphi\) phase \(\ThetaPhase\), which mediates cross-boundary coherence in coarse-grained limits. These statements are formalized in the Lean development and provide the bridge to continuum continuity equations in mesh-refinement limits.

\paragraph*{Built-in collapse.} Because dynamics minimizes \(\Ccost=\int \Jcost(r(t))\,dt\), a recognition event (definite pointer) occurs automatically when the accrued cost crosses a threshold: \(\Ccost\ge 1\). No measurement postulate is added; collapse is an intrinsic transition of the same discrete dynamics. This threshold admits concrete mesoscopic predictions developed in Sec.~\ref{sec:predictions}.

The remainder of the paper quantifies the small-deviation regime where \(\Rhat\approx\Hhat\) and derives the Hamiltonian and Schrödinger limits (Sec.~\ref{sec:emergence}), followed by explicit predictions in regimes where the two frameworks differ (Sec.~\ref{sec:predictions}).

\section{Hamiltonian as Emergent Phenomenon}\label{sec:emergence}
We now quantify the regime in which the Recognition Operator \(\Rhat\) reduces to energy-based Hamiltonian dynamics and derive the Schrödinger equation as a continuum limit.

\paragraph*{Deviation parameters.} Let \(r>0\) denote a dimensionless ratio measuring proximity to equilibrium. Two equivalent small parameters are useful:
\begin{itemize}
  \item additive deviation \(\delta := r-1\);
  \item log-deviation \(\varepsilon := \ln r\) so that \(r=e^{\varepsilon}\).
\end{itemize}
The recognition cost admits the exact identities
\begin{equation}\label{eq:J_exact_forms}
  \Jcost(1+\delta) = \frac{\delta^2}{2(1+\delta)},\qquad \Jcost(e^{\varepsilon})=\cosh(\varepsilon)-1.
\end{equation}
Accordingly, the series in \(\varepsilon\) has only even powers,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:J_series_log}
  \Jcost(e^{\varepsilon}) = \tfrac12\varepsilon^2 + \tfrac1{24}\varepsilon^4 + \tfrac1{720}\varepsilon^6 + \cdots,
\end{equation}
whereas the series in \(\delta\) is alternating with leading term \(\tfrac12\delta^2\).

\paragraph*{Quadratic approximation and error bounds.} The quadratic approximation \(\Jcost \approx \tfrac12\varepsilon^2\) is uniformly accurate for small \(|\varepsilon|\). Since all higher terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:J_series_log} are nonnegative, we have the bound for \(|\varepsilon|<\sqrt{20}\):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bound_series}
  0 \le \Jcost(e^{\varepsilon}) - \tfrac12\varepsilon^2 = \sum_{k\ge 2}\frac{\varepsilon^{2k}}{(2k)!}
  \;\le\; \frac{\varepsilon^4}{24}\,\frac{1}{1-\varepsilon^2/20}.
\end{equation}
Thus, for \(|\varepsilon|\le 0.1\) the relative deviation from the quadratic term obeys
\begin{equation}\label{eq:relative_error}
  \frac{\Jcost(e^{\varepsilon})-\tfrac12\varepsilon^2}{\tfrac12\varepsilon^2} \le \frac{\varepsilon^2}{12(1-\varepsilon^2/20)} \;<\; 0.01.
\end{equation}
This justifies the \(\lesssim\!1\%\) claim over a broad small-deviation domain. If one instead expands in \(\delta=r-1\), the exact formula in Eq.~\eqref{eq:J_exact_forms} shows a linear-in-\(\delta\) correction factor \(1/(1+\delta)\); the log parameter \(\varepsilon\) is therefore the canonical small variable for tight bounds.

\paragraph*{Effective quadratic generator.} In the small-\(|\varepsilon|\) regime, minimizing \(\Ccost=\int \Jcost\,dt\) reduces locally to minimizing a quadratic functional. Linearizing \(\Rhat\) around equilibrium yields an effective near-isometry on the relevant submanifold. There exists an operator \(\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\) such that one step of the eight-tick update can be written
\begin{equation}\label{eq:linearization}
  \Rhat = \exp\!\Bigl(-\,\frac{i}{\hbar}\,\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\,\bigl(8\TauZero\bigr)\Bigr) + O\bigl(\TauZero^2\bigr),
\end{equation}
with \(\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\) determined by the second variation of \(\Rhat\) with respect to \(\varepsilon\) at equilibrium,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Heff_from_R}
  \Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}} \;\approx\; \Bigl.\partial_{\varepsilon}^2\,\Rhat\Bigr|_{\varepsilon=0}.
\end{equation}
The precise proportionality follows from the normalization \(\Jcost''(1)=1\) and the units bridge \(\hbar=E_{\!\mathrm{coh}}\,\TauZero\) (Methods).

\paragraph*{Continuum limit and Schrödinger dynamics.} Writing \(\Delta t=8\TauZero\) and expanding Eq.~\eqref{eq:linearization} gives, for sufficiently smooth states,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:schro_limit}
  \frac{s(t+\Delta t)-s(t)}{\Delta t} \;=\; -\,\frac{i}{\hbar}\,\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\,s(t)\; +\; O(\Delta t).
\end{equation}
Taking \(\TauZero\to 0\) with appropriate coarse-graining yields the Schrödinger equation
\begin{equation}
  i\hbar\,\partial_t s(t) = \Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\,s(t),
\end{equation}
thereby exhibiting Hamiltonian dynamics as the continuum, small-deviation limit of recognition-cost minimization.

\paragraph*{Why standard physics works.} Many laboratory and astrophysical systems are close to equilibrium on the relevant scales, with typical \(|\varepsilon|\sim 10^{-2}\!\text{--}\!10^{-1}\). In this regime Eqs.~\eqref{eq:relative_error}--\eqref{eq:schro_limit} show that (i) the quadratic term dominates \(\Jcost\), (ii) \(\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\) governs the dynamics to high precision, and (iii) the eight-tick discreteness is invisible under coarse graining. Departures from \(\Hhat\) appear only when \(|\varepsilon|\) grows, when \(t\sim 8\TauZero\), or when intrinsic thresholding (\(\Ccost\ge 1\)) triggers non-Hamiltonian transitions; these regimes are explored in Sec.~\ref{sec:predictions}.

\section{Predictions Where $\Rhat\neq\Hhat$}\label{sec:predictions}
We outline three classes of experiments that distinguish recognition dynamics from energy-based Hamiltonian evolution. Each test specifies a measurable, a predicted signature, and a falsifier.

\paragraph*{4.1 Extreme non-equilibrium (large deviations).} When local deviations from equilibrium satisfy \(|\varepsilon|\gtrsim 1\), the higher-order terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:J_series_log} become non-negligible: \(\Jcost(e^{1})-\tfrac12\cdot 1^2\approx 0.086\), and the gap grows with \(|\varepsilon|\). Recognition dynamics predicts that the recognition cost decreases, \(d\Ccost/dt\le 0\), while the coarse-grained energy budget need not be conserved during rapid redistributions,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_eq_sig}
  \frac{d}{dt}\,\Ccost(t)\;\le\;0\quad\text{but}\quad \frac{d}{dt}\,E_{\text{eff}}(t)\;\neq\;0\;
  \text{ over a window }\;W.
\end{equation}
\emph{Systems:} shock tubes and detonation fronts; ultrafast martensitic phase fronts; laser-induced ablation with nanosecond-to-picosecond diagnostics. \emph{Observable:} define a dimensionless response ratio \(r(t)=O(t)/O_{\!*}(t)\) (e.g., pressure, density, or intensity relative to a reference), estimate \(\Ccost_W=\int_W\!\Jcost(r(t))\,dt\), and compare to the measured energy change \(\Delta E_W\). \emph{Signature:} windows with \(\Delta E_W\neq 0\) while \(\Delta\Ccost_W<0\). \emph{Falsifier:} all windows obey \(\Delta E_W=0\) whenever \(\Delta\Ccost_W<0\).

\paragraph*{4.2 Ultra-fast processes (discrete-time signatures).} With \(\TauZero\) the fundamental tick, the minimal recognition cycle is \(8\TauZero\). In coarse-grained limits this periodicity is hidden, but near the fundamental scale a residual aliasing appears in pump--probe correlations. Define \(\Delta t=8\TauZero\). \emph{Prediction:}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:aliasing}
  S(\tau)\;=\;\langle O(t)\,O(t+\tau)\rangle\;\text{exhibits sidebands at}\; \tau\approx n\,\Delta t.
\end{equation}
\emph{Systems:} high-harmonic generation and attosecond/femtosecond pump--probe spectroscopy; ultrafast electron diffraction. \emph{Observable:} cross-correlation residuals after removing continuum fits. \emph{Signature:} statistically significant peaks at integer multiples of \(8\TauZero\) (with \(\TauZero\) set by the units bridge or fit as a single global parameter across datasets). \emph{Falsifier:} no excess power at \(n\,8\TauZero\) across stacked experiments.

\paragraph*{4.3 Mesoscopic quantum thresholds (intrinsic collapse).} Because collapse is built-in, recognition predicts a sharp transition in coherence when the time-integrated cost crosses unity,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C_threshold}
  \Ccost\;=\;\int_{0}^{T}\!\Jcost\bigl(r(t)\bigr)\,dt\;\gtrsim\;1\quad\Longrightarrow\quad \text{loss of superposition.}
\end{equation}
\emph{Systems:} nanogram-scale mechanical oscillators or levitated nanoparticles prepared in spatial superpositions. \emph{Observable:} visibility \(\mathcal{V}(T)\) of interference fringes vs mass and interrogation time. \emph{Signature:} a threshold-like drop in \(\mathcal{V}\) at curves satisfying Eq.~\eqref{eq:C_threshold}, consistent with a single global \(\TauZero\) and cost \(\Jcost\). \emph{Falsifier:} persistence of high visibility \(\mathcal{V}\) in regimes where Eq.~\eqref{eq:C_threshold} predicts collapse, or the need for free parameters beyond \(\TauZero\) and the fixed \(\Jcost\).

\paragraph*{4.4 Brief note on boundary effects.} In settings where observer-system boundaries matter, the \(\Ccost=2A\) bridge implies additional couplings that we do not exploit here. Section~\ref{sec:unification} summarizes these links; the tests above avoid boundary-dominated interpretations by design.

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Unification}\label{sec:unification}
Recognition dynamics supplies concise bridges across traditionally separate domains. We summarize the operational content without elaboration, as each item is formalized elsewhere.

\paragraph*{Matter (Z-patterns).} The invariants preserved by \(\Rhat\) include integer-valued pattern charges \(Z\). These act as conserved labels for stable excitations and underlie discrete ladder structures that persist through recognition updates. At coarse scales, conservation of total \(Z\) induces continuity equations in the continuum limit.

\paragraph*{Measurement (\(\Ccost=2A\)).} A previously established identity equates recognition action to twice a residual gravitational action, \(\Ccost=2A\). Operationally, this identifies measurement-induced collapse (threshold \(\Ccost\ge 1\)) with a corresponding variational extremum in the residual action. The bridge provides a common normalization route for units (see Methods) while keeping the present work focused on recognition dynamics.

\paragraph*{Gravity (ILG kernel).} In linear regimes the recognition weighting induces an effective information-limited kernel (ILG) that modifies source terms while preserving continuity. Phenomenologically, this appears as a scale-dependent weight in rotation/growth analyses with no per-system tuning, consistent with a single recognition timescale \(\TauZero\) and fixed exponents. We do not rely on ILG here; the link is noted for completeness.

\paragraph*{Consciousness (boundary minima).} In boundary-dominated settings, localized minima of a consciousness functional built on \(\Ccost\) (with additional terms) correspond to definite experiences. For the present paper, the only role of this sector is to motivate that collapse is intrinsic to \(\Rhat\) and not an external postulate; no phenomenology from this sector is required here.

Taken together, these bridges reinforce that a single discrete operator \(\Rhat\) governs matter labels, measurement thresholds, and effective gravitational weighting, with domain-specific elaborations deferred to specialized manuscripts.

\section{Falsification and Experimental Protocols}\label{sec:falsification}
We enumerate hard falsifiers and give concrete, parameter-light protocols. Any one falsifier suffices to reject recognition dynamics as formulated here.

\paragraph*{Hard falsifiers.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Alternate convex symmetric cost on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\).} Exhibit a cost \(\tilde J\) analytic on \(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\), symmetric \(\tilde J(x)=\tilde J(x^{-1})\) on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\), convex on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\), normalized with \(\tilde J(1)=0\) and \(\tilde J''(1)=1\), but \(\tilde J\neq \tfrac12(x+x^{-1})-1\). This violates T5 (cost uniqueness).
  \item \emph{Hamiltonian succeeds where recognition fails.} Identify a regime in which standard Hamiltonian evolution with fixed \(\Hhat\) matches all observables while the recognition prediction (with fixed \(\Jcost\) and a single \(\TauZero\)) fails, after accounting for coarse graining. This contradicts the emergent \(\Hhat\) claim.
  \item \emph{Threshold mismatch \(\Ccost\) vs \(A\).} In boundary-sensitive experiments, demonstrate a systematic offset between the recognition threshold (\(\Ccost\ge 1\)) and the residual action threshold (\(A\ge 1\)) across protocols that should map via \(\Ccost=2A\). This breaks the bridge.
  \item \emph{Eight-tick failure.} Observe a universally shorter spatially complete recognition cycle than \(2^3=8\) without violating atomicity or timestamp uniqueness, or demonstrate that no eight-tick-compatible coarse limit recovers standard continuity. This invalidates T6.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Protocols.}
\begin{description}
  \item[\(\Delta E\) vs \(\Delta\Ccost\) in shocks/phase fronts.] Use shock tubes or rapidly driven phase transitions with high-speed diagnostics (pressure/density imaging). Define a dimensionless response ratio \(r(t)=O(t)/O_{\!*}(t)\). Compute \(\Delta\Ccost_W=\int_W\!\Jcost(r(t))\,dt\) over windows \(W\), and compute the corresponding energy change \(\Delta E_W\). \emph{Prediction:} existence of windows with \(\Delta E_W\neq 0\) while \(\Delta\Ccost_W<0\). \emph{Falsifier:} \(\Delta E_W=0\) whenever \(\Delta\Ccost_W<0\).
  \item[Ultra-fast discretization.] In attosecond/femtosecond pump--probe or ultrafast electron diffraction, fit and remove the smooth continuum of the two-time correlation \(S(\tau)=\langle O(t)O(t+\tau)\rangle\). Stack residuals across runs. \emph{Prediction:} sidebands at \(\tau\approx n\,8\TauZero\) with a single \(\TauZero\) across the stack. \emph{Falsifier:} no excess power at \(n\,8\TauZero\) within statistical sensitivity.
  \item[Mesoscopic collapse at \(\Ccost\approx 1\).] Prepare spatial superpositions of levitated nanoparticles or nanogram oscillators. Map interference visibility \(\mathcal{V}(T)\) across mass and interrogation time. Estimate \(\Ccost=\int_0^T\!\Jcost(r(t))\,dt\) using calibrated response ratios. \emph{Prediction:} threshold-like drop of \(\mathcal{V}\) along curves with \(\Ccost\approx 1\), consistent with a single global \(\TauZero\). \emph{Falsifier:} sustained high visibility in regions where \(\Ccost\gtrsim 1\) or a need for ad hoc free parameters.
\end{description}

Where applicable, negative controls (e.g., shuffled windows, randomized phase references, or misaligned stacks) should inflate residuals or destroy signatures, providing internal checks that the detected effects are recognition-specific rather than analysis artifacts.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
\paragraph*{Rigor vs assumptions.} Our derivations rest on minimal, explicit assumptions: the Meta Principle (information-theoretic), analytic/symmetric/convex cost axioms on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\) with normalization \(\Jcost''(1)=1\), atomic update (one posting per tick), and spatial completeness over a period. Under these, the theorems on exactness (potential uniqueness up to constants) and minimal eight-tick periodicity follow, and the cost \(\Jcost(x)=\tfrac12(x+x^{-1})-1\) is unique (T5). We emphasize that where we invoke continuum limits and coarse graining, we do so transparently and restrict claims accordingly.

\paragraph*{Limits of current formalization.} While the core theorems (cost uniqueness, eight-tick minimality, conservation on closed chains) are machine-verified, some bridges---notably full units quotients and certain kernel ablations---are presently documented as methods-level scaffolds rather than fully internalized formal statements. Our Schrödinger limit relies on a mesh-refinement hypothesis and smoothness assumptions standard in discrete-to-continuum arguments. Tight, system-dependent constants in the small-\(\varepsilon\) error bounds can be further refined.

\paragraph*{Implications.} First, Hamiltonian mechanics is explained as an emergent quadratic approximation to recognition-cost minimization. This resolves the conceptual asymmetry between postulated energy minimization and observed stability while integrating collapse as an intrinsic threshold phenomenon (\(\Ccost\ge 1\)). Second, a single operator \(\Rhat\) coherently links matter labels, measurement, and effective gravitational weighting at the level of operational predictions, suggesting a compact organizational principle for cross-domain phenomena.

\paragraph*{Future work.} Experimentally, the three test classes in Sec.~\ref{sec:predictions} can be advanced with existing platforms: higher dynamic range in shock diagnostics for \(\Delta E\) vs \(\Delta\Ccost\); improved stacking/denoising in ultrafast correlations for discrete-time sidebands; and stability-enhanced levitated platforms to traverse the \(\Ccost\approx 1\) contour without hidden tuneables. Theoretically, priorities include strengthening discrete-to-continuum proofs, containerizing the RG and ILG reference pipelines with versioned artifacts, and formalizing additional bridges in Lean.

\paragraph*{Scope and approximation domain.} We stress that \(\Hhat\) is a superb approximation in small-deviation regimes: to leading order, \(\Jcost\approx \tfrac12\varepsilon^2\) and the induced \(\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\) reproduces standard dynamics with <1\% deviations for \(|\varepsilon|\lesssim 10^{-1}\). The claims of departure are confined to demonstrably large deviations, ultra-fast windows near \(8\TauZero\), or thresholded transitions. Beyond these domains, we expect and find continuity with conventional predictions.

  \item (T5, cost uniqueness) Under analyticity on \(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\), symmetry \(\Jcost(x)=\Jcost(x^{-1})\) on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\), convexity on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\), normalization \(\Jcost(1)=0\) and \(\Jcost''(1)=1\), the unique solution is \(\Jcost(x)=\tfrac12(x+x^{-1})-1\).
  \item (T6, eight-tick minimality) Any spatially complete, ledger-compatible walk on \(Q_3\) has minimal period \(2^3=8\); a Gray cycle attains the bound.
  \item (Discrete exactness) If the sum of edge-increments vanishes on all closed chains, the field is an exact coboundary: \(w=\nabla \varphi\), with \(\varphi\) unique up to constants on reach components.
  \item (Continuity mapping) Under mesh refinement with bounded fluxes, discrete conservation yields \(\partial_t\rho+\nabla\cdot J=0\) and gauge \(\varphi\mapsto\varphi+\mathrm{const}\).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Series and emergence.} Exact forms:
\begin{align}
  \Jcost(1+\delta) &= \frac{\delta^2}{2(1+\delta)},\\
  \Jcost(e^{\varepsilon}) &= \cosh(\varepsilon)-1 
   \,=\, \tfrac12\varepsilon^2 + \tfrac1{24}\varepsilon^4 + \cdots.
\end{align}
The quadratic approximation dominates for \(|\varepsilon|\ll 1\), defining an effective generator \(\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\approx \bigl.\partial_\varepsilon^2\,\Rhat\bigr|_{\varepsilon=0}\). Writing \(\Delta t=8\TauZero\) and linearizing one update step,
\begin{equation}
  \Rhat = \exp\!\Bigl(-\,\frac{i}{\hbar}\,\Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\,\Delta t\Bigr) + O(\Delta t^2),
\end{equation}
whence the Schrödinger equation emerges in the continuum limit:
\begin{equation}
  i\hbar\,\partial_t s(t) = \Hhat_{\!\mathrm{eff}}\,s(t).
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Units bridges.} Recognition timescale \(\TauZero\) and Planck/curvature anchors admit concise identities:
\begin{align}
  \lambda_{\mathrm{rec}} &= \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{\pi c^3}},\\
  \hbar &= E_{\!\mathrm{coh}}\,\TauZero.
\end{align}
These appear as ledger--curvature and IR gates, respectively, and are used only for unit consistency; all qualitative claims in the main text are dimensionless.

\paragraph*{Proof sketches and citations.} T5 leverages symmetry and analyticity to constrain \(\Jcost\) to a single-parameter family, fixed by \(\Jcost''(1)=1\). T6 uses a Gray-code Hamiltonian cycle argument on \(Q_3\) together with atomicity and timestamp uniqueness to forbid shorter periods. Discrete exactness follows from vanishing closed-chain sums via standard cochain arguments. Continuum correspondence identifies incidence with divergence under mesh refinement. Full proofs and certificate traces are provided in the repository modules cited above.
